## Learning from Data - Final Project ##
### Hyperpartisan News and Political Bias Detection ###

The script that will run the model is: run_group8.py. 
For a smooth execution, the following files should be in the same directory as the run_group8.py file:
- training set: hyperp-training-grouped.csv.xz
- test set
- classification.py
- balance_training_data.py
- preprocess_data.py

The script should be run with 2 arguments: run_group8.py <train set> <test set>

We ran the script with python 3 and the following packages:

pandas - version 0.25.1 
numpy - version 1.16.2
scikit-learn - version 0.21.3     
nltk - version 3.4
