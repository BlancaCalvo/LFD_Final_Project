Notes Final Project

- average political news articles
- n-grams: source names should be removed from the training data, because they won't be on the test data (might be too good predictors)
- look at shared task from previous years to see what absolutely did not work
- only give necessary output, no interactive output
- look at label distribution
- evaluation is 3-fold: 1 label, other label, both labels
- Hand-in deadline: 29 October
- using named entites (words in the window of named entities)
- right wing vs. left wing embeddings/connotations
- extreme left vs. extreme right wing --> infer binary from multilabel task? or have 2 classifiers?
- LOOK AT THE DATA
