Perhaps Mitt Romney played it right when he was meek and contrite in response to the Washington Post?s front-page allegations that he bullied a kid half a century ago in high school. 
Romney no doubt feels embarrassed by the charges, even if most of us struggle to understand their relevance or gauge their veracity. But the time is coming for Romney to get angry, very angry, with what is increasingly, quaintly called ?the mainstream media.? 
The Post?s decision to play up the story as if it were major news ? front page, thousands of drably dull self-serious words piled high to elevate and justify the one buzzy nugget ? is an embarrassment. It was clearly intended to link Romney to the new progressive cause: fighting anti-gay bullying, in the context of President Obama?s ?sudden? support for gay marriage. It was naked advocacy gussied up as journalistic due diligence. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
It was also a significant error ? if you work from the assumption (as I do) that the Post and other mainstream media outlets are determined to do what they can to re-elect Obama ? because they tipped their hand too early. 
It?s always dangerous to ascribe singular purpose to a collective entity like ?the media.? Of course, there are individual figures who ? despite whatever personal biases they may have ? are trying their best to be fair. But as a generalization, the mainstream media are so deep in the bunker for Obama, they could ride out a nuclear war without having their Jenga tower fall over. 
In 2004, John Kerry?s war record embellishments and involvement with a radical group that at one time discussed a plot to assassinate U.S. senators who supported the Vietnam War were treated as fixations of the deranged right. Evan Thomas, then of Newsweek, proclaimed what pretty much everyone knew: The press ?wants Kerry to win.? And that was John Kerry, a man few in Washington like and many consider to be a pompous human toothache. 
Obama, meanwhile, is beloved. In 2008, concerns about the man?s past were largely brushed aside, ignored or re-spun to fit the acceptable story line. 
No doubt some believe that if a Republican candidate had a hate-spewing pastor and associated with an admitted former domestic terrorist, the mainstream media would be equally dismissive. After all, who cares about that? I mean, how can that stack up news value-wise against a 17-year-old hazing a kid at school nearly 50 years ago? 
In 2008, the imperative was to clear the field for the first black president. Now that that box has been checked, a new story line is needed. Enter Newsweek. It features Obama with a rainbow-colored halo (because conventional halos are so Republican!), touting him as the ?First Gay President.? 
Tina Brown, the editor of Newsweek and the Daily Beast, may be a genius. No doubt it has gotten boring saying Obama?s opponents are racist. Now the press can treat his critics as homophobes, even the ones holding the same position on gay marriage that Obama (publicly) held for the last decade ? until last week. 
The Obama campaign?s rationalization for the president?s decision to drop what most knew was a calculated political lie is that it would ?fire up? his base among rich liberal donors and college students. It did that. 
But it also fired up his base in the press corps, enabling writers to rekindle their obsession with the ?historic? nature of the Obama presidency. 
As the London Telegraph blogger Tim Stanley writes, everything the president does is cast as part of history. The president could go ?seal-clubbing and much of the media would see it as a new epoch for winter sports. ?Barack Obama Becomes the First President to Kill Six Seals in Under One Minute,? the New York Times would proudly report.? 
It?s worth noting that there?s little evidence ? yet ? that Obama?s decision will actually help him with voters, voters who are increasingly less deferential to campaigns from traditional media outlets. (Indeed, the latest CBS News/New York Times poll has Romney gaining and shows that two-thirds of Americans believe Obama?s gay marriage announcement was politically motivated.) 
Still, it never hurts to have good press. In football, they sometimes refer to the cheerleading and noise from the fans as the ?12th man? on the (normally 11-man) team. The media are revving themselves up to be Obama?s 12th man, and the time is coming for Romney to call them on it, with passion.

China is the No. 1 emitter of climate-changing greenhouse gases but also the top investor in solar, wind and other renewable energy. It has promised to cap coal use and rein in growth of carbon dioxide emissions. 
?As a responsible developing country, China?s plan, determination and policy to tackle climate change is resolute,? foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. 
Beijing?s collaboration on climate with Trump?s predecessor, Barack Obama, had been seen as a bright spot in a bilateral relationship with numerous strains. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
Trump has called climate change a hoax created by China and promised to unwind Obama?s measures to curb global warming. Trump?s order Tuesday rescinded nearly a dozen measures enacted by Obama. Trump said he wanted to create more coal mining jobs, though industry analysts say demand is likely to decline as the price of solar, wind and other alternatives falls. 
Asked about Trump?s order at a regular news briefing, Lu didn?t mention the United States or the American president but said Beijing was committed to carrying out its pledges under the Paris climate agreement negotiated in 2015. 
Signed by 170 countries, the agreement calls for holding global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in hopes of preventing sea level rise and environmental damage. 
All signers should ?fulfill their pledges and implement the agreement with positive actions,? Lu said. 
?We are willing to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with the international community to advance the global process of climate governance and promote the green, low-carbon and sustainable development so as to build a better future for next generations,? he said. 
China long resisted binding emissions limits, citing its economic development needs. Its about-face began in 2014 when President Xi Jinping, in a joint declaration with Obama, set a 2030 deadline for emissions to stop rising. 
Despite the lack of a formal commitment, China already is making faster progress than most countries due to official efforts to reduce reliance on steel production and other heavy industry and to promote technology and consumer spending. 
China has spent heavily on solar, wind and hydro power to clean up smog-choked cities and curb surging reliance on imported oil and gas. Researchers say that means carbon dioxide emissions are likely to peak before 2025, well ahead of the official target. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
China?s 2015 spending of $103 billion was more than double the U.S. level of $44 billion, according to the U.N. Environment Program. China leads the world in wind and hydro generating capacity and is No. 2 behind Germany in solar. 
Last year, Chinese coal consumption fell 4.7 percent, its third annual decline, according to official data. Coal?s share of total energy consumption fell to 62 percent from 2015?s 64 percent. 
In a report last week, the environmental groups CoalSwarm, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace said an unexpectedly sharp decline in the number of new coal-fired power plants being built in China and India improved chances that climate targets could be met. The two countries have suspended construction of more than 100 power plants, though dozens more still are due to come online by 2020. 
Beijing also sees renewable energy as a commercial opportunity. Its leading solar panel producers are among their global industry?s biggest competitors and Chinese state-owned utilities are building or buying wind and solar farms in Europe and Latin America. 
A plan released in January by the Cabinet?s planning agency calls for spending another 2.5 trillion yuan ($360 billion) on renewable energy by 2020 in an effort to clean up smog-choked Chinese cities. 
Still, the Cabinet says it expects at least 62 percent of China?s power to come from coal in coming decades. 
The development plan calls for doubling the share of China?s energy from non-fossil fuels to 20 percent by 2030. But that will only bring China into line with today?s global average. 
Trump?s order initiates a review of the Clean Power Plan, which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants. 
The order also lifts a 14-month-old moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands. The Obama administration had argued the program must be modernized to ensure a fair financial return to taxpayers and address climate change. 
The order covers a range of other Obama-era rules, including repeal of measures to consider the ?social cost? of carbon emissions in all regulatory actions and crack down on methane emissions at oil and gas wells. It also eliminates a rule restricting fracking on public lands and another that requires energy companies to provide data on methane emissions at oil and gas operations."

Besides his farewell address to the nation Tuesday night, Obama has been on a media blitz during his final weeks in office. The biggest broadcast networks have all been granted interviews, culminating in a full-circle talk Sunday on CBS? ?60 Minutes.? The History network airs a two-hour interview special on Sunday and next week CNN shows its own two-hour film, ?The End: Inside the Last Days of the Obama White House.? 
Obama also gave lengthy interviews to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin for a Vanity Fair feature and to Jann Wenner for his 10th Rolling Stone magazine cover. First Lady Michelle Obama gave Oprah Winfrey an exit interview and she?ll appear on NBC?s ?The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon? on Wednesday. 
?I don?t remember (an exit) that has been as orchestrated and fulsome as this one,? said David Gergen, co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University?s Kennedy School and an aide to four presidents. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
Gergen also can?t recall a president-elect who so forcefully promised to undo the achievements of his predecessor, so he understands Obama?s motivation to get his message across. 
Obama was the 10th president to deliver a formal farewell address, and his speech in Chicago was the first one before a public audience, said Gleaves Whitney, director of Grand Valley State University?s Center for Presidential Studies. 
The first three farewell messages weren?t speeches at all ? they were written and submitted to the press, Whitney said. Harry Truman began the modern tradition of televised addresses, which have been intermittently followed. 
Historically, farewells by George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower are considered the most impactful because they offered warnings to the country. Washington, in a message published in 1796, talked about how excessive political factionalism could threaten the nation?s unity. Former World War II commander Eisenhower, speaking in 1961, spoke about the danger of giving the military-industrial complex too much power. Obama spoke about dangers to democracy from within. 
But the traditional farewell is far from the only way Obama is trying to leave an impression. 
?President Obama has taken the legacy theme to a new level,? Whitney said on Wednesday. ?The election of Donald Trump is the biggest rebuttal and rebuke that anyone can imagine. No one saw it coming. I think he and many people in his party are stunned by the rebuke. 
?He wants to squeeze every opportunity with the bully pulpit to make his case that, you know, the last eight years were not that bad,? he said. 
Obama is benefiting from the media?s sense of nostalgia that is common for exiting two-term presidents, said Gergen, also a CNN commentator. He?s leaves on a high note in popularity: a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday showed him with a 55 percent approval rating, compared to 37 percent for Trump. 
The president is also intent on spreading his viewpoint ?because in the next few weeks there?s going to be a deluge coming the other way,? Gergen said. 
ABC?s George Stephanopoulos featured his Obama interview on his Sunday political talk show, ?This Week.? NBC?s Lester Holt interviewed Obama on Air Force One and in a restaurant in Chicago?s Hyde Park on Tuesday. The network is already showing portions of the interview, with the bulk reserved for a prime-time hour on Friday, ?Barack Obama: The Reality of Hope.? 
Television?s most popular newsmagazine, ?60 Minutes,? will devote its full hour on Sunday to Steve Kroft?s interview with Obama that took place Monday in the White House. Kroft and Obama have a history: Obama gave him the first television interview after he was elected in 2008.

Is it true that illegal immigrants who sign up and who have paid no income taxes will get back $24,000 though they have not paid any income taxes? 
____________________________________ 
Is it true that illegal immigrants who receive amnesty and a Social Security number would receive Earned Income Tax Credits for the previous three years without paying taxes for those years? 
FULL ANSWER 
Several readers have asked if President Obama is ?granting amnesty bonuses to illegal immigrants.? 
No, the administration isn?t giving automatic payments to all immigrants who may be affected by executive actions the president announced in November. 
However, it?s possible that some of those who have been working while living in the U.S. illegally ? even if they paid no income tax ? could receive several thousands of dollars in tax credits from the IRS if they file tax returns. 
But Republican Rep. Paul Gosar went way too far at a town hall meeting in Arizona on Feb. 9 when he claimed ?each illegal alien will get $24,000 in compensation.? 
That amount is the maximum in tax credits that a family with three or more children could receive if they filed a tax return this year and amended tax returns for work done in past years. 
What is this all about? 
Obama?s immigration actions would allow parents illegally residing in the U.S. for at least five years, and who also have children who are citizens or legal permanent residents, to remain in the country for up to three years without the threat of deportation, if they register and pass a background check. If they meet the requirements, they would also be given work authorization for the three-year period and would be able to get a Social Security number. 
With that Social Security number, they would be able to file new tax returns, or amend old ones, and possibly claim the earned income tax credit that helps low-income workers. 
IRS Commissioner John Koskinen confirmed that fact during a hearing before the&#160;House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Feb. 11. 
Koskinen: ? to be eligible for the earned income tax credit you have to work. It?s in the earned income tax credit. 
Rep. Mick Mulvaney: Correct. 
Koskinen: To apply ? be able to apply for it, you have to have a Social Security number. 
Mulvaney: OK. 
Koskinen: So if you either are ? we have about 700,000 [Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers] out there by the illegal immigrants who are paying taxes ? 
Mulvaney: Correct. 
Koskinen: ? but they?re not eligible to apply because they don?t have a Social Security number. 
Mulvaney: But several million of them will get Social Security numbers under the new program, right? 
Koskinen: And under the new program, if you get a Social Security number and you work, you?ll be eligible to apply for the earned income tax credit. You will get them ? an amount depending on your situation. 
Koskinen told Mulvaney and other committee members that ?if you get a Social Security number, you can then file for this year if you?re working, and if you earned income in the three years before that and filed, you?ll be eligible.? 
Those living in the country illegally and working can file tax returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers, but those ITINs can?t be used to claim the earned income tax credit. So, those who filed with an ITIN would have to submit amended returns to receive any credits. 
But Koskinen also said that even those who had not filed tax returns in the past could attempt to claim the credits for work done up to three years ago. 
?If you did not file, you?ll have to file a return and you?ll have to file to demonstrate with the same information you would ? anybody else would that you actually earned income and, therefore, [are] eligible,? he said. 
That last point about non-filers was a clarification from an earlier Senate Finance Committee hearing on Feb. 3, in which Koskinen mistakenly told committee members that only those immigrants who had previously filed returns would be eligible to claim the credits retroactively. 
We should note that the EITC is a refundable tax credit. That is, if the credit is greater than a worker?s tax liability, the IRS will refund the difference. The IRS will even refund the amount of the credit if the worker ? whether a citizen or immigrant who qualifies for the reprieve from deportation ? paid no income tax. 
$24,000 ?Bonuses?? 
So how much could those successfully claiming the credits receive? 
Gosar, an Arizona congressman, said ?it was learned that the household income deferred tax credit applies retroactively three years. So each illegal alien will get $24,000 in compensation.? That?s not accurate at all. 
As we said, there is no automatic payment for anyone. Even those who apply for the tax credits are not guaranteed to get anything, let alone the highest amount possible. 
Some have correctly noted that for those with large families ? having at least three qualifying children ? the tax credits could amount to as much as $24,000 over four years. But that?s only if the immigrants qualified for the maximum credit of about $6,000 each year and owed little to no income tax on their earnings. 
Those eligible for the EITC could receive a lot less depending on their income, marital status and family size. The income limits and credit ranges for 2014 are as follows: 
So a $6,000 credit each year is by no means a guarantee. 
According to IRS statistics, nearly 28 million people received the EITC in 2013, totaling more than $66 billion. The average credit that year was $2,407."

Kerber, who won last year?s Australian and U.S. Open for her first major titles, has opened the new season with one win in two tournaments in Brisbane and Sydney. The Australian Open starts Monday in Melbourne. 
?The first matches of the year are always tough, and I?m still not feeling my rhythm,? Kerber said. ?I made too many mistakes. I was not feeling the ball. 
?It?s the second tournament of the year. We have still a lot to go, so I will not do a big drama about that match.?

Kasatkina broke Kerber?s serve five times and registered her first win ever against a top five player. 
?Difficult to explain because I beat No.1 in the world and . doesn?t happen every day,? the 19-year-old Russian said when asked about her emotions after the career-high win. ?I think I get some confidence.? 
She moved into a quarterfinal against sixth-seeded Johanna Konta, who beat Daria Gavrilova 6-1, 6-3 
Eugenie Bouchard continued her resurgent run heading into the season?s first major with a 6-4, 6-3 win over WTA Finals champion Dominika Cibulkova to reach the quarterfinals in Sydney. 
Bouchard improved her career record to 4-1 against Cibulkova, who was ranked No. 5 and was voted the WTA?s comeback player of the year in 2016 after her title win at the season-ending championship. 
?Any time you play one of the best players in the world it?s like a standard of where you?re at,? said Bouchard, who had a wild-card entry in Sydney. ?Every time I have played a match with Domi, we have had the toughest battles. 
?I have won, I guess, more often than not, but everyone is a really tough battle.? 
Bouchard had an early break in the second set, but dropped serve and allowed Cibulkova, a finalist at the 2014 Australian Open, a way back into the match.

But the Canadian star broke again quickly and held onto the advantage, and later attributed her recent improvement to a reunion with coach Thomas Hogstedt. 
Bouchard had a breakout season in 2014, reaching the semifinals at the Australian Open and French Open before making the final at Wimbledon. But she has only gone past the fourth round at a major once since then and slipped to No. 46 at the end of last year. 
After winning back-to-back matches at a tournament for the first time since August in Cincinnati, she will play a quarterfinal against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who beat defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-5, 6-3. 
?I have taken a couple of solid steps this week, but I?m far from where I want to be,? Bouchard said. ?Even though I won, to me, I could do a lot of things better.? 
Former No. 1-ranked Caroline Wozniacki beat Yulia Putintseva 6-0, 7-5 to move into a quarterfinal against Barbora Strycova, who ousted No. 9-seeded Roberta Vinci 6-2, 6-3. 
No. 2-ranked Agnieszka Radwanska had a 7-6 (1), 6-1 win over Christina McHale and will next play Chinese qualifier Duan Yingyang, who beat Coco Vandeweghe 6-3, 6-2 to make the quarterfinals. 
In men?s first-round matches, Alex De Minaur beat Benoit Paire 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (1), Andrey Kuznetsov was leading 2-6, 6-1, 3-0 when No. 7-seeded Martin Klizan retired, and No. 6 Gilles Muller advanced over Alexandr Dolgopolov.

OAKLAND, Calif. ? Lawyers for California and the U.S. Department of Justice clashed in court Tuesday over whether new rules from President Donald Trump?s administration would dramatically reduce women?s access to free birth control. 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Ethan Davis urged a federal judge not to grant the state?s request to block the policy change to President Barack Obama?s health care law, saying it was not clear any women would lose no-cost contraception coverage. 
The law required most companies to cover birth control at no additional cost, though it included exemptions for religious organizations. The new policy allows more categories of employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing free contraception to women by claiming religious or moral objections.

Washington state, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania also have sued the Trump administration over the rules. The California attorney general?s office said U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam was the first judge to hold a hearing to determine whether to block the rules while California?s lawsuit moves through the courts. 
Delaware, Maryland, New York and Virginia joined California in its effort. 
At the hearing, Davis said California had not pointed to any woman who would be affected. 
?It?s the state burden to show you someone,? he told Gilliam, who was nominated to the court by Obama in 2014 and did not immediately issue a ruling. 
California says the rules could result in millions of women in the state losing free birth control services. 
Julie Weng-Gutierrez, a lawyer with the California attorney general?s office, said losing free contraception would lead to unintended pregnancies, taxing the state?s health care and other social programs. 
?When the cost of contraception increases, women are more likely to use less effective methods of contraception or none at all,? she said. 
She added, ?The court does not need to wait for the ax to fall here. There is sufficient harm.? 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued the new policy in October. It marked another step in the Trump administration?s rollback of Obamacare, and supporters say it promotes religious freedom. 
Attorneys for the Trump administration said in court documents that the rules are about ?protecting a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors from being forced to facilitate practices that conflict with their beliefs.? 
California?s lawsuit says the new rules violate the U.S. Constitution by overvaluing religious beliefs and discriminating against women. It says the Trump administration also violated federal law by acting without allowing for public comment or providing a proper legal or factual basis for the change. 
The judge pressed the Justice Department attorney on why the administration didn?t follow the standard notice and comment period before implementing the policy. Davis said the issues had been aired in previous comments to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
?This issue has been thoroughly ventilated,? he said."

The California attorney general?s office said U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam was the first judge to hold a hearing to determine whether to block the rules while California?s lawsuit moves through the courts.</p> \n<p>Delaware, Maryland, New York and Virginia joined California in its effort.</p> \n<p>At the hearing, Davis said California had not pointed to any woman who would be affected.</p> \n<p>?It?s the state burden to show you someone,? he told Gilliam, who was nominated to the court by Obama in 2014 and did not immediately issue a ruling.</p> \n<p>California says the rules could result in millions of women in the state losing free birth control services.</p> \n<p>Julie Weng-Gutierrez, a lawyer with the California attorney general?s office, said losing free contraception would lead to unintended pregnancies, taxing the state?s health care and other social programs.</p> \n<p>?When the cost of contraception increases, women are more likely to use less effective methods of contraception or none at all,? she said.</p> \n<p>She added, ?The court does not need to wait for the ax to fall here. There is sufficient harm.?</p> \n<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued the new policy in October. It marked another step in the Trump administration?s rollback of Obamacare, and supporters say it promotes religious freedom.</p> \n<p>Attorneys for the Trump administration said in court documents that the rules are about ?protecting a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors from being forced to facilitate practices that conflict with their beliefs.?</p> \n<p>California?s lawsuit says the new rules violate the U.S. Constitution by overvaluing religious beliefs and discriminating against women. It says the Trump administration also violated federal law by acting without allowing for public comment or providing a proper legal or factual basis for the change.</p> \n<p>The judge pressed the Justice Department attorney on why the administration didn?t follow the standard notice and comment period before implementing the policy. Davis said the issues had been aired in previous comments to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p> \n<p>?This issue has been thoroughly ventilated,? he said.</p></article>\n'"

But experts say the trial ? the first stemming from the fatal May 2015 shooting ? could reach far beyond the single case, as the government tries to convict other leaders and dozens of members. 
It has been nearly 2 ? years since a confrontation between the Bandidos and the Cossacks left nine bikers dead and 20 wounded outside a Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco. Local police arrested 177 bikers after the mayhem, and more than 150 people were eventually charged. 
Federal investigators also indicted the president and vice present of the Bandidos ? though not for the shooting in Waco ? and are set to bring them to trial next year. Five other Bandidos have pleaded guilty to federal charges. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
The first to stand trial in Waco is Christopher ?Jake? Carrizal, the Bandidos? Dallas chapter president, whose trial began last week. Experts say a conviction in the case could have a domino effect by convincing other bikers to plead guilty and testify. 
?Guys who are less involved start to turn and lead prosecutors all the way to the top guys,? said Charles Falco, a law enforcement instructor and a former informant on California biker gangs for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
Carrizal, 35, is charged with directing organized criminal activity that led to a violent brawl at the restaurant in Waco on May 17, 2015. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
The outcome of his trial also could affect federal prosecutions of former Bandidos president Jeffrey Pike and vice president John Portillo. While the Waco shootout isn?t mentioned in the federal indictments against both men on racketeering charges, including ordering killings and assaults, government witnesses have discussed the Waco incident in pretrial hearings, court records show. 
?Anything presented in state court, where the standard for getting evidence admitted in lower, can be used in the federal trial,? said Heidi Lambros, a criminal law public defender in Chicago. 
Biker gangs are a small but violent criminal force in the U.S., with some 44,000 members or associates of a handful of ?outlaw? gangs, according to a 2015 FBI report. The Bandidos, founded in Texas, is among the largest of the criminal gangs, along with the Hells Angels and a couple of others. 
The Cossacks were considered less violent until the Waco confrontation. 
The start of any Waco trials was delayed by the enormous volume of evidence and several bikers? attempts to have their cases dismissed. Defense attorneys argued the bikers were hastily arrested and charged without consideration of individual culpability. Carrizal?s attorney, Casie Gotro, has said that the McLennan County District Attorney?s office denied her client access to certain records and may have ?tampered? with evidence.

Investigators recovered hundreds of weapons after the shooting, including firearms, knives and brass knuckles strewn across the restaurant and adjacent parking lot. State prosecutors said they were also awaiting results from DNA tests to determine who held the weapons used in the deaths and assaults. 
Carrizal?s trial was scheduled to begin Sept. 11, but it was reset after the first presiding judge was recused over the appearance of potential bias in favor of the state. Carrizal unsuccessfully sought the removal of the replacement judge, too. 
Gotro said the tight security at the Waco courthouse during Carrizal?s trial was having a chilling effect on public access to the trial. 
Last week, Gotro asked presiding state District Court Judge Matt Johnson if there had been specific threats that required additional security for the trial. She said a review of jury questionnaires showed that half of the potential jurors were scared to be there. 
Johnson deferred to McClennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara, who told The Associated Press on Thursday that ?I have to do everything I can to provide safety to the citizens.? 
McNamara declined to say whether the measures address a specific threat."

While the gruesome details and bloody images from the investigation into the death of Dawn Vigil were displayed all too often for the jurors and Vigil?s family during the trial, one man was conspicuously absent during Friday?s closing arguments: Defendant Dorall Smith, 33. 
?I have been defending an empty chair,? defense attorney Liane Kerr told the jurors about the defendant during her closing argument in the court room of Judge Ross Sanchez. ? ? It?s an awkward situation.? 
A newspaper delivery man found Vigil?s body before 5 a.m. on Sept. 2, 2010, as it lay in a pool of blood in front of her house near Chico Road and Chelwood Park Boulevard NE in Albuquerque, according to police. Police followed trails of blood into her home, where they discovered it on a light switch and near Vigil?s baby?s crib.

Police wrote in a criminal complaint that Smith confronted Vigil and a male friend on the afternoon of Sept. 1. The friend told police that Vigil was shaking in fear when Smith confronted them and called her a ?bitch.? Vigil also told a relative that Smith threatened to kill her if she was ever with someone else. 
The day before her death, Vigil and a male friend drove past Smith and overtly displayed their affection, according to testimony. Vigil was found dead the next morning.

On Feb. 15, 2011, the front page of the Albuquerque Journal revealed Albuquerque gang unit officer Detective Trey Economidy III, who shot and killed a suspect after a traffic stop, listed his occupation as ?human waste disposal? on his Facebook page. 
Police Chief Ray Schultz said then he was ?disgusted? by the comment and launched an internal affairs investigation into the shooting and the posting. 
In the ensuing months, as postings and shootings piled up, Schultz and Mayor Richard Berry vowed to change the Albuquerque Police Department for the better. Schultz made every APD officer read and sign a new social media policy, and a flurry of news releases announced new training and new procedures. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
And on June 15, 2012, one year and four months after the human waste disposal posting raised questions about the mindset of some on the police force, it turns out the department still has a ways to go. 
How else could the department?s elite Repeat Offender Project have continued to use a hangman?s noose on its letterhead? Why else would it have a mural of one on the office wall? 
To make matters worse, ROP team Cmdr. Doug West ? who comes off sounding like the sergeant in ?Hogan?s Heroes? ? questions whether the drawing is of a noose because he?s ?not a knot expert,? insulting the intelligence of every Albuquerque taxpayer. 
To his credit, Schultz has now discontinued use of the noose image. That?s the right thing to do, but for some reason the message isn?t getting through. And not just to rank and file, but to higher echelon officers who are supposed to carry out the chief?s agenda. 
Their SOP should include correcting problems before getting caught. And in some cases, even that?s not enough. 
The city continues to fight the federal judge who, in a case with facts so bizarre they would be hard to make up, ruled that deploying 47 officers as well as snipers; repeatedly using attack dogs, bean bag rounds and electric current; and evacuating a neighborhood to deal with an intoxicated 60-year-old guy whose only weapon was his not-so-smart mouth was overkill. Chief U.S. District Judge Bruce D. Black wisely reversed the jury in the March 2009 incident involving Tony Nelson, saying ?no reasonable person could believe that an inhibited, slow-moving senior citizen who made no physical or verbal threats and wielded no weapons could constitute a threat to the safety of any of the 47 armed and shielded police officers who stood 20 feet away.?

Their majors are almost universally in the math and science focused fields ? engineering, medicine, and architecture, for example.&#160; Not one of these foreigners is studying communications, art history or psychology.&#160; Yet, it seems like every college-age young adult I knew was planning to study these soft, non-science, non-math-based subjects.&#160; Even my own children had studied history, English and music as opposed to engineering or medicine. 
The importance of my anecdotal findings was brought into sharp relief by Tom Friedman?s March 3rd column in the New York Times, which included the following quote by Intel CEO Paul Otellini: 
?While America still has the quality work force, political stability and natural resources a company like Intel needs, the U.S. is badly lagging in developing the next generation of scientific talent and incentives to induce big multinationals to create lots more jobs here.? 
The statistics back up Otellini?s opinion and my observations.&#160; In the most recent census of Ph.D. recipients at U.S. universities, the vast majority who had studied in engineering, physical sciences and computer sciences were non-U.S. citizens.&#160; Nearly 70 percent of engineering doctorates were conferred on foreign students, around 60 percent in math, more than 50 percent in the physical sciences, and approximately 65 percent in computer science.&#160; Americans had the overwhelming edge in psychology (nearly 90 percent), social sciences (more than 60 percent), biological sciences (65 percent), and earth sciences (61 percent).&#160; 
What?s causing this shift in emphasis by U.S. students into the softer arenas?&#160; Is it simply the naturally occurring evolution of a great and powerful nation?&#160; Is it a trend that cannot be stopped or dealt with by our society? 
I have a sense of the problem based on anecdotal evidence and the observed experience of a teacher (my wife) for more than 25 years:&#160; we get the education that we demand for our kids.&#160; Parents often go to the mat with teachers and administrators to make certain that their children get higher grades and less demanding work.&#160;&#160; The happiness of our children has become paramount to parents, and the resultant epidemic of grade inflation and stress-free education has opened the door for the children of other cultures to move into the sweet spot of Intel?s (and other forces in technology?s) hiring practices.

A jury found Ayers, 18, guilty of second-degree murder for the death of Lucero, 51, a man he severely beat in Los Lunas on Aug. 7, 2009. Lucero died in the hospital a few weeks later. 
Ayers has been in custody for three years and will get credit for time served, which results in 12 more years behind bars. 
District Judge William Sanchez called the crime a ?horrific offense,? and said he agreed with defense attorney Rachel Walker Al-Yasi that the then-15-year-old had a lack of guidance and supervision before the incident. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
?But, at some point, Mr. Ayers has to make decisions on his own to behave himself,? Sanchez said last Tuesday. ?I really don?t see a lot of remorse on his face.? 
Sanchez denied a request from Al-Yasi for Ayers to be placed on probation at the Delancey Street Foundation, an organization that rehabilitates certain individuals, such as substance abusers and those who have committed crimes. 
Ayers was found not to be amenable to treatment. 
On that August night, Ayers apparently became upset after Lucero refused to tell him where his mother was. 
During the trial in December 2011, a man who let Lucero stay at his RV testified that he came home to find Ayers, who lived close by, beating Lucero outside in the parking lot of his Los Lunas home. 
The man testified he was able to pull Ayers off Lucero and called police a short time later. He told the jury he told police where Ayers lived. 
The man said Ayers threatened that he would ?kill him? if he told anyone about the incident. 
Two Los Lunas police officers testified that there was spattered blood spread throughout the interior of the RV, including on couch cushions, linens and cabinets where the incident took place. Photos showed to the jury included Lucero?s battered, bloody face. 
A forensic pathologist for the Office of the Medical Investigator testified that Lucero sustained fractures to the sternum and rib cage. He also had fractures to cheek and nasal bones. 
The pathologist testified that the autopsy showed Lucero died from complications of his blunt force injuries. The death was classified as a homicide. 
The judge said he sentenced Ayers to the maximum sentence because he couldn?t take a chance that Ayers would be released and be harmful to the public. ?

".......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... 
Donald Trump on Wednesday morning angrily denounced news reports about potentially compromising information Russia has allegedly gathered about him, citing denials from the Kremlin that it has any such intelligence. 
The president-elect also charged via Twitter that his ?crooked opponents? are trying to undermine his electoral victory. He accused the intelligence community of leaking the information to get in ?one last shot at me,? saying, ?Are we living in Nazi Germany?? 
Trump?s comments follow the revelation Tuesday night that a classified report delivered to Trump and President Obama last week, according to U.S. officials, included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising information about Trump?s personal life and finances. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
The officials said that U.S. intelligence agencies have not corroborated those allegations but believed the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign. 
Trump on Wednesday will hold his first news conference since July. He is certain to face questions about his relationship with Russia and the intelligence community?s conclusion that the Kremlin attempted to sway the outcome of the election in his favor, primarily through disseminating information obtained from the hack of Democratic email systems. 
Trump has cast doubt on the veracity of this conclusion, and he and his aides have aggressively pushed back against the idea that it had any effect on the election, calling the story a ?witch hunt? being carried out by his political enemies. 
Earlier Wednesday, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin called the allegations that Russia has collected compromising information about Trump an ?absolute fantasy.? 
Soon after, Trump tweeted: ?Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is ?A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.? Very unfair!? 
Most media organizations reported only on the existence of the report and that intelligence officials had included a summary of it in their briefings with Trump and Obama on Russia?s attempts to sway the election. But BuzzFeed News published a document supposedly created by a former British intelligence official. The information it contains has not been verified.

Under pressure from religious and conservative groups, the Obama administration has offered another compromise on the issue of birth control coverage within the Affordable Care Act. 
While exempting churches and some religiously affiliated institutions, such as hospitals and universities, from supplying the coverage, the new proposal calls for their employees to receive stand-alone private insurance policies providing birth control coverage at no cost. 
Insurance companies will foot the bill, but only the naive can possibly think the cost won?t find its way back to the institution in the form of higher health premiums. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
Numerous lawsuits filed against this and other portions of ?Obamacare? will proceed and for good reason: the federal government seems intent on setting rules on matters of conscience and worse, defining what constitutes a church, or religious institution. 
One of the litigants is Hobby Lobby, a chain of craft stores, whose CEO, David Green, is an evangelical Christian. Green says, ?We simply cannot abandon our religious beliefs to comply with this mandate.? 
That mandate includes, in addition to contraceptive coverage in employees? health care, ?preventive services,? including ?morning-after? pills and other drugs, which Green considers abortifacients. 
After Hobby Lobby?s appeal to Justice Sonia Sotomayor was rejected, the Christian Post reports the company then made plans to ??shift the beginning of its employee health plan to temporarily avoid $1.3 million a day in fines for each day since Jan. 1 that it did not comply with the Affordable Care Act.? (According to the new health care law, businesses with more than 50 employees that refuse to comply can be fined by the IRS $100 per day per employee.) Hobby Lobby?s appeals continue. 
The core issue as I see it ? and there are others ? is whether the government has the right to define a church as a building in which people congregate on Sundays and whether a private company headed by a religious person qualifies for conscience exemptions. 
For government to decide such things violates the establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment, which state ?Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof?? and appears to put the state in the position of supreme authority and arbiter of what constitutes ?legitimate? religious faith and practice. 
The Supreme Court will likely have to resolve its constitutionality. 
Permit me to offer the justices some assistance.

The early church was not a building with a towering steeple. The early church met in homes. If one accepts New Testament teaching (and what higher authority on the church could there be?), the concept of the church being an organism that resides in each individual believer is clearly spelled out in several passages. 
Paul the Apostle writes in his letter to the Colossians (1:24) about the ?body? of Jesus Christ, ?which is the church.? By this, he means the ?body of believers? in whom Christ dwells. Wherever that body is, whether an individual, or a group of believers, that?s the church. It was only later that this concept of church was turned into something with expensive buildings, tax exemptions and denominations. 
The same theme can be found in Revelation where John is asked by Jesus to write letters to several churches. Those, too, were bodies of believers, not physical structures. 
In the Old Testament, God told Solomon that while He was too big to live in buildings, He would ?dwell? in the Temple Solomon built for Him. Ultimately, though, He said He had other intentions: ?I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.? (Jeremiah 31:33) 
That was and remains for believers the authentic church, so when people say, ?I am going to church,? it is an impossibility because they can?t go to themselves. 
The administration?s efforts to effectively gerrymander lines between what it considers legitimate religious practice and the secular is what the Founders hoped to avoid when they linked the establishment clause with the free exercise clause. 
That is why, among other reasons, government should not mandate birth control coverage as part of any national health care plan.

The 'Austrian Language' 
In the article ["" Obama?s ?Bumbles,? "" June 17], the claim ""If any other of our presidents had visited Austria and made Reference to the Nonexistent 'Austrian language,' would you have brushed It off as a minor slip?"" was stated as true. 
As I am Austrian, I would state that as partly true. Austrians speak Austrian German (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_German). This is not a dialect. It is a distinct official language in Austria. There are distinct official differences to the Standard German spoken in Germany. The differences are similar to American and British English. 
[FactCheck.org wrote:] ""The people of Austria mainly speak German, but they also speak Turkish, Serbian, Croatian and a few other languages."" There are first- or even second-generation immigrants that speak Turkish and Serbian; they are not official languages unlike Hungarian, Croatian and Slovene which are official languages in parts of Austria. 
Please take this into consideration and keep up the good work. 
Daniel Ultsch Graz, Austria 
In the Ask FactCheck section regarding the ?Obama?s ?Bumbles? ? e-mail, an explanation was given about the President?s reference to ?the Nonexistent 'Austrian language'? whereby you noted the claim was ?True.? Technically, it?s partly true at best. In Austria, they speak ?sterreichisches Deutsch, which, though a variation of Standard German, contains unique words, phrases, and grammar. More important, if one were to query an Austrian that his language is ?nonexistent,? he or she would dispute that assertion, and probably produce an ?sterreichisches W?rterbuch. I thought the record on FactCheck?s responses should remain as accurate as possible. Thanks for all your work.

But that doesn't make ""Australian"" its own language. The Oxford English Dictionary says that ""German"" is a ""language,"" but does not say the same about ""Austrian."" We also consulted two linguists, who were divided on this issue. Stephen R.

He added that ""whether to call them separate languages or separate dialects is usually more a social and political question than a linguistic one."" But Jay Jasanoff, a professor of linguistics at Harvard University, told us: ""You weren't wrong.&#160; The native language of Austria (or, if you prefer, 'of most Austrians') is German.""

Thank You 
I just want to say Thank You for finding the truth behind what all the politicians and pundits are saying. It makes things much easier to discern with this election coming up next year. I cannot remember things being so volatile in the past. I am just glad I found you and PolitiFact.com. Again, Thank You and the hardworking staff for the countless hours spent finding the truth or lies behind the statements we hear.

Any chance of a FactCheck News program?

Political Extremism 
As we enter the election season, it becomes apparent why our politicians exhibit dysfunctional thinking. Posturing on the right and left for the nomination results in untenable economic proposals that appeal only to the extremes and are generally dismissed as such by economists and even former politicians from the same party. The Bachmann and DeMint proposals ["" Deficit Arithmetic: Cut Everything 34% Now?"" June 27] are as ridiculous as those of the democratic extreme to ""just raise taxes."" Meanwhile the U.S. economy and our standing internationally ""goes to hell in a hand basket"" as nothing is accomplished by our overpaid and pampered ""party elites.""

The historian and arch journalist spent 2015 studying the modern Democratic Party.

Onto the stage before us came former secretary of state Clinton, the Democratic Party?s heir apparent; Melinda Gates, the wife of the richest man in the world (the event was produced with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation); various NGO executives; a Hollywood celebrity; a Silicon Valley CEO; a best-selling author; an expert in women?s issues from Georgetown University; a Nobel Prize winner; and a large supporting cast of women from the Third World.

The hardship those Third World women have endured and the entrepreneurial efforts they have undertaken are powerful symbols of the struggle of American professional women to become CEOs of Fortune 500 companies (one of the ambitions that was discussed in detail) or of a woman to be elected president, which was the unspoken theme of the entire event. 
Reviewing Clinton?s tenure as President Obama?s secretary of state, Frank found that she advanced ?a version of feminism in which liberation is, in part, a matter of taking out loans from banks in order to become an entrepreneur.? 
Clinton?s other great initiative during her State Department days was the so-called Hillary Doctrine: the recasting of the United States as the world?s defender of women and girls.

The share of unemployed American men age 25 to 54 has more than tripled since the late 1960s. Many of them want to work, but the wages paid by what few jobs are available don?t support a desirable quality of life. They struggle with a loss of income and dignity, and suffer diminished mental and physical health as a result. 
Even before the issue of low wages is considered, the fundamental reality is that the jobs aren?t there. The most recent federal data shows that there are only 4.8 million jobs available for 10 million prime-age men in addition to men and women of all ages. 
Additionally, foreign competition and technological advances have eliminated many of the jobs that were available to people who didn?t go to college. A New York Times/CBS News/Kaiser Family Foundation poll ?that provides a detailed look at the lives of the 30 million Americans 25 to 54 who are without jobs,? found that 85 percent of prime-age men without jobs also lack bachelor?s degrees. One-third said they had criminal records, which makes finding work even harder. 
 
 
?Many men, in particular, have decided that low-wage work will not improve their lives,? The New York Times reports. Changes in American society, including the availability of federal disability benefits, the decline of marriage, and the rise of the Internet mean it?s easier for them to live without working. Men without spouses or partners don?t have to earn incomes big enough to support a family, and the Internet has made unemployment less isolating. 
Laziness is not the cause. Among the 45 percent of men who said they had looked for a job in the last year, large majorities said they would be willing to work nights and weekends, start over in a new field, return to school or move to a new city to get one. Those who qualify for disability fear that returning to work would mean the loss of their benefits ? followed by the loss of their new job. 
?I would rather be working,? said one middle-aged man interviewed by the Times. ?Then I wouldn?t be so bored.? 
In an article published Dec. 12, the Times described the effect on the national economy: 
The resulting absence of millions of potential workers has serious consequences not just for the men and their families but for the nation as a whole. A smaller work force is likely to lead to a slower-growing economy, and will leave a smaller share of the population to cover the cost of government, even as a larger share seeks help. 
?They?re not working, because it?s not paying them enough to work,? said Alan B. Krueger, a leading labor economist and a professor at Princeton. ?And that means the economy is going to be smaller than it otherwise would be.? 
? ?When the legal, entry-level economy isn?t providing a wage that allows someone a convincing and realistic option to become an adult ? to go out and get married and form a household ? it demoralizes them and shunts them into illegal economies,? said Philippe Bourgois, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the lives of young men in urban areas. ?It?s not a choice that has made them happy. They would much rather be adults in a respectful job that pays them and promises them benefits.?

The harsh economic policies implemented in Greece and other countries in recent years have been shown to have a detrimental effect on mental health and well-being. While this may seem obvious to some, many governments and policymakers don?t seem to have kept it in mind when causing entire populations to suffer under austerity measures. 
The Independent: 
Austerity measures in Greece resulted in a ?significant, sharp, and sustained? increase in suicides, according to 30-year study published in the British Medical Journal this week. 
 
 
The study, led by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, found that there was a 35 per cent rise in suicide cases in June 2011 ? the same time as the government imposed further austerity measures to pay the country?s debts ? which was sustained through 2012. 
During the study ? from 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2012 ? researchers tracked the suicide rate and identified the effects of ?austerity? and ?prosperity? factors on the numbers. 
?We found that perhaps it is the economic policies themselves, but also the public messaging of these policies by the government and the press that are both driving the changes in suicide,? [said Charles Branas, lead author of the study].

According to the latest poll conducted by CBS ?60 Minutes? and the magazine Vanity Fair, 61 percent of Americans want to raise taxes on the wealthy as the primary way to cut the budget. The same poll finds that the second most popular first choice for cutting the nation?s budget deficit, at 20 percent, is cutting the military budget. That is, 81 percent of us?four out of five?would cut the deficit by taxing the rich and/or slashing military spending. 
Only four percent of those polled favored cutting Medicare, the government-run program that provides health care for the elderly and disabled, and only three percent favored cutting Social Security. 
President Obama meanwhile, appointed a so-called National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (quickly dubbed the ?Catfood Commission? by critics) to come up with proposals to cut the budget deficit. He named as co-chairs former Republican Senator from Wyoming Alan Simpson, a troglodyte sworn enemy of Social Security who publicly declared it to be ?a milk cow with 310 million tits,? and Erskine Bowles, a retired investment banker and former chief of staff to President Clinton who says he want to cut spending, not raise taxes, which, when it comes to Social Security, means lower benefits for retirees. 
The writing on the wall appears to be that the White House, and Democrats and Republicans in Congress, are looking to raise the retirement age, currently 66, to 68 or 69, to reduce or at least limit the inflation adjustment in Social Security benefits, and perhaps also to increase the payroll tax on current workers. What they want to do is balance the budget by screwing with our retirement. What they do not want to do is raise taxes on the rich and on investment income, two steps which, if taken, could fully fund Social Security indefinitely into the future. 
Already, the president and Congress have agreed to extend tax breaks for the rich, even though the vast majority of the American public wants the rich to pay higher taxes. 
A second poll, this time by CNN, reports that 63 percent of Americans oppose the US War in Afghanistan and want it ended. Only 35 percent say they support the war (now in its ninth year). 
Yet the president, who originally promised he would end US involvement in 2011, is now saying the US will ?end combat operations? in that war-torn country in 2014?a turn of phrase that doesn?t even mean the war would be ended that year (US combat operations allegedly ended in Iraq last summer, but some 50,000 American troops and many more private mercenaries are still there today and will be next year too, unless they are thrown out by the Iraqi government). 
Even on the matter of cutting military spending, and with the US currently at war, a Financial Times/Harris poll found in November of last year that a third of Americans thought cutting the Pentagon budget was a good idea, and another third said it would not be a bad thing, with only just over a third saying it was a bad idea. Only 30 percent said that they were concerned that cutting military spending might pose a security risk. Instead of cutting though, the Obama administration with Congressional backing has continued to raise military spending to record levels not seen since World War II, when the US was in a state of all-out war and full national mobilization. 
Last April, while Congress was considering the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform bill, a Pew poll found that 64 percent of Americans favored regulations placing a maximum limit on the permissible size of a bank. Only 27 percent opposed such a limit. Yet Congress passed, and the president signed into law, a bill that allows banks to grow even larger, without any constraint on size. 
A Pew Charitable Trust poll released last March found that 52 percent of Americans favor setting limits on carbon emissions by vehicles and power plants, even if such limits meant higher energy prices. Only 35 percent opposed such limits on emissions. And yet Congress and President Obama have refused to offer up with any plan to limit CO2 emissions.

He named as co-chairs former Republican Senator from Wyoming Alan Simpson, a troglodyte sworn enemy of Social Security who publicly declared it to be ?a milk cow with 310 million tits,? and Erskine Bowles, a retired investment banker and former chief of staff to President Clinton who says he want to cut spending, not raise taxes, which, when it comes to Social Security, means lower benefits for retirees.</p> \n<p>The writing on the wall appears to be that the White House, and Democrats and Republicans in Congress, are looking to raise the retirement age, currently 66, to 68 or 69, to reduce or at least limit the inflation adjustment in Social Security benefits, and perhaps also to increase the payroll tax on current workers. What they want to do is balance the budget by screwing with our retirement. What they do not want to do is raise taxes on the rich and on investment income, two steps which, if taken, could fully fund Social Security indefinitely into the future.</p> \n<p>Already, the president and Congress have agreed to extend tax breaks for the rich, even though the vast majority of the American public wants the rich to pay higher taxes.</p> \n<p>A second poll, this time by CNN, reports that 63 percent of Americans oppose the US War in Afghanistan and want it ended. Only 35 percent say they support the war (now in its ninth year).</p> \n<p>Yet the president, who originally promised he would end US involvement in 2011, is now saying the US will ?end combat operations? in that war-torn country in 2014?a turn of phrase that doesn?t even mean the war would be ended that year (US combat operations allegedly ended in Iraq last summer, but some 50,000 American troops and many more private mercenaries are still there today and will be next year too, unless they are thrown out by the Iraqi government).</p> \n<p>Even on the matter of cutting military spending, and with the US currently at war, a Financial Times/Harris poll found in November of last year that a third of Americans thought cutting the Pentagon budget was a good idea, and another third said it would not be a bad thing, with only just over a third saying it was a bad idea. Only 30 percent said that they were concerned that cutting military spending might pose a security risk. Instead of cutting though, the Obama administration with Congressional backing has continued to raise military spending to record levels not seen since World War II, when the US was in a state of all-out war and full national mobilization.</p> \n<p>Last April, while Congress was considering the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform bill, a Pew poll found that 64 percent of Americans favored regulations placing a maximum limit on the permissible size of a bank. Only 27 percent opposed such a limit. Yet Congress passed, and the president signed into law, a bill that allows banks to grow even larger, without any constraint on size.</p> \n<p>A Pew Charitable Trust poll released last March found that 52 percent of Americans favor setting limits on carbon emissions by vehicles and power plants, even if such limits meant higher energy prices. Only 35 percent opposed such limits on emissions. And yet Congress and President Obama have refused to offer up with any plan to limit CO2 emissions.</p> \n<p /></article>'"

These were deaths that were caused by a surge.&#160; Not the surge of which George Bush was so proud but an electrical surge that was not planned and in a well managed war would never have happened.&#160; The reports of the deaths were almost unnoticed and might still languish in the graveyard of Bush mistakes alongside the corpses he helped create, were it not for the death of Sgt. Ryan D. Maseth. 
In January of this year Sgt. Maseth was taking a shower on his base in Baghdad and was electrocuted because of defective electrical wiring. &#160;At first the army explained to Sgt. Maseth?s mother that her son had an electrical appliance with him in the shower that caused his electrocution. That, as so much else associated with this war is, was a lie. He was electrocuted because a water pump in the building was not properly grounded and when the shower was turned on Sgt. Maseth was electrocuted.&#160; Sgt. Lambeth was not the first person to be electrocuted. According to Pentagon documents more than 12 other people have been electrocuted and many more injured by electrical shocks. In one barracks there were almost daily reports of its inhabitants receiving electrical shocks. 
According to the New York Times an Army survey of February 2007 noted ?a safety threat theater-wide created by the poor-quality electrical fixtures procured and installed, sometimes incorrectly, thus resulting in a significant number of fires.? In early July of this year an electrical fire resulted in the destruction of 10 buildings. 
The first thing one is tempted to do when learning of something like this is to assume it is KBR?s fault. That is because KBR is the poster child for what went wrong with private contractors in Iraq.&#160; Among other things, it charged for food it did not serve the troops, it failed to build a pipeline for which it was paid $75.7 million and failed to deliver safe water for hygiene uses. &#160;(Some people may wonder how one company can get so much wrong.&#160; The answer is since the war began it has been paid more than $24 billion and has 40,000 employees in Iraq. &#160;That affords it lots of opportunity to perform incompetently and it has taken advantage of many of them. More are coming its way. &#160;KBR was recently awarded a part of a $150 billion contract for restoring the oil fields in Iraq.&#160; It will develop the southern oil fields while two other companies, one of which, Parsons, that has had its own share of shoddy performance, will develop those in the North.) 
It would not be fair to blame KBR for Sgt. Maseth?s death just because it was responsible for the Radwaniya Palace Complex (RPC) where Sgt. Maseth died. &#160;&#160;That is because it is not required to act prophilactically.&#160; Reporting on the RPC electrocution, CNN reported that KBR said its contract did not cover ?fixing potential hazards.?&#160; It was only required to fix things after they broke down.&#160; KBR and the Pentagon would probably agree that a shower that electrocutes the bather is a shower that has broken down but the only way that can be discovered is after someone has been electrocuted. Heather Browne, a KBR spokeswoman, said the company found no link between its work and the electrocutions. &#160;&#160;As is sometimes the case when KBR explains what happens, not everyone agrees with its self-analysis. 
Ingrid Harrison, an official with the Pentagon?s contracting management agency was quoted in the Times as saying:&#160; ?KBR has been at R.P.C. for over four years and was fully aware of the safety hazards, violations and concerns regarding the soldiers? housing.? KBR, said she, &#160;?chose to ignore the known unsafe conditions.?&#160; Electricians who were formerly employed by KBR said their repeated warnings to their superiors as well as to military personnel about unsafe electrical conditions were ignored. 
That probably explains why 283 electrical fires took place between August 2006 and January 2007. &#160;There should be fewer in the future.&#160; According to the New York Times, ?senior army officials have ordered electrical inspection of all buildings in Iraq maintained by KBR. Chris Isleib, a spokesman for the Pentagon said:&#160; ?We consider this to be a very serious issue.?&#160; He got that right.&#160; KBR, as usual, got it wrong.&#160; It won?t affect its shareholders?only the soldiers who have died or been injured and the taxpayer who pays the company for its incompetence.

(Photo: Michael Probst/AP) 
(REPORT) ? According to Trump biographers Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher ? authors of the recent publication ?Trump Revealed? ? Trump has long relied on a unique bargaining tool as leverage with banks: his personal guarantee. Using his name as leverage, he has repeatedly negotiated better terms worth hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to his Trump Organization, a Trump-owned private real estate development company owning and operating several properties, hotels and casino resorts among other businesses Bloomberg reported. This has been especially true of Deutsche Bank, Germany?s largest bank as well as one of the world?s most insolvent banks ? largely believed to be on the brink of collapse. 
As a result of this unique agreement with one of its highest profile clients, Deutsche Bank, is scrambling to restructure at least part of its roughly $300 million debt to reduce the conflict of interest that has arisen following Trump?s assumption of the presidency. Supplanting the personal guarantee of the now President of the United States could lead to less favorable terms. Concurrently swirling conflicts of interest involve wealthy Russian Deutsche Bank client stock trades, which have been muddied by Trump?s recent moves to improve relations with Russia as well as multi-billion dollar penalties pending against Deutsche Bank due to a mortgage-bonds scandal. While Trump has nominally handed over his businesses to his sons, he continues to own the business. Ethics watchdogs are sounding the alarm over the possibility of a foreign entity holding such sway over the President of the United States. 
In a veritable firestorm of conflicts of interest related to Trump?s considerably complex assets, this relationship dwarfs them all. Deutsche Bank has been Trump?s major creditor lending him upwards of billions of dollars over the years, becoming his main backer. The relationship became established after other banks refused to work with him the in wake of several bankruptcies. 
Brandon Garrett, a University of Virginia law professor and author of ? Too Big To Jail: How Prosecutors Compromise with Corporations?, stated that: ?Deutsche poses the biggest conflict that we know about in terms of dollar amounts and the scale of legal exposures?[the bank] may have tried to do its best to avoid the appearance of impropriety but it may be impossible for them to do so.? 
Bloomberg reports that Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush noted that ?When you have political appointees making decisions about banks that the president owes a lot of money to, it looks terrible.? He added that ?The US Government is dealing with regulatory and criminal issues with big banks all the time, and if he owes them a lot of money, there might be an incentive to favor less regulation and less enforcement for the banks.? For a candidate who ran on his business savvy and negotiating skills, this possibility is not too difficult to manage. 
Deutsche Bank has declined to comment on the ongoing restructuring and investigations. In response to burgeoning allegations surrounding the Trump organization, Trump has tried to minimize the relationship stating that the loans are a relatively small portion of the Trump multi-billion dollar empire and that the loans relying on personal guarantee are slated to be restructured as standard debt after the projects are completed. It remains to be seen if this statements will suffice to placate Trump?s critics.

124360	413071	TRUE	left	https://counterpunch.org/2009/10/05/dissolve-the-palestinian-authority/	publisher	https://counterpunch.org/	2009-10-05	Dissolve the Palestinian Authority	"Palestinian civil society has strongly and almost unanimously condemned the Palestinian Authority?s latest decision to delay adoption by the UN Human Rights Council of the report prepared by the UN Fact-Finding Mission, headed by justice Richard Goldstone, into the recent Israeli war of aggression against the Palestinian people in the occupied Gaza Strip.&#160; A common demand in almost all Palestinian statements issued in this respect was for the UN to adopt the report and act without undue delay on its recommendations in order to bring an end to Israel?s criminal impunity and to hold it accountable before international law for its war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza and, indeed, all over the occupied Palestinian territory. 
Succumbing to US pressures and unabashed Israeli blackmail, the president of the PA himself reportedly was himself responsible for the decision to defer discussion at the Council of the Goldstone report, dashing the hopes of Palestinians everywhere as well as of international human rights organizations and solidarity movements that Israel will finally face a long overdue process of legal accountability and that its victims will have a measure of justice.&#160; This decision by the PA, which in effect delays adoption of the report at least until March 2010, giving Israel a golden opportunity to bury it with US, European, Arab and now Palestinian complicity, constitutes the most blatant case yet of PA betrayal of Palestinian rights and surrender to Israeli dictates. 
This is not the first time, though, that the PA has acted under orders from Washington and threats from Tel Aviv against the express interests of the Palestinian people.&#160; The historic advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in July 2004 that found Israel?s Wall and colonies built on occupied Palestinian territory illegal had presented a rare diplomatic, political and legal opportunity that could have been used to isolate Israel as apartheid South Africa was after a similar ICJ decision in 1971 against its occupation of Namibia.&#160; Alas, the PA squandered it and systematically ? quite suspiciously, actually ? failed to even call on world governments to comply with their obligations stated in the advisory opinion. 
The whole clause on Israel and Palestinian rights that was to be discussed at the recent UN Durban Review Conference in Geneva was dropped after the Palestinian representative gave his green light.&#160; Efforts by non-aligned nations and the former UN General Assembly president, Father Miguel d?Escoto Brockmann, to push for a UN resolution condemning Israel?s war crimes in Gaza and establishing an international tribunal were thwarted mainly by the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, causing several prominent diplomats and international law experts to wonder which side the official Palestinian representative was on. 
The Mercosur-Israel Free Trade Agreement was almost ratified by Brazil this last September after the Palestinian ambassador there expressed approval, only urging Brazil to exclude Israeli settlement products from the Agreement.&#160; With prompt action by Palestinian and Brazilian civil society organizations and eventually by the PLO?s Executive Committee, this ratification was averted and the Brazilian parliamentary committee in charge of this file recommended that the government refrain from approving the FTA until Israel complies with international law. 
In all these cases and many similar ones, the instructions to the Palestinian representatives came from Ramallah, where the PA government has illegally appropriated the PLO powers to lead Palestinian diplomacy and set foreign policy, conceding Palestinian rights and acting against the Palestinian national interests, without worrying about accountability to any elected representatives of the Palestinian people. 
This latest forthright collusion of the PA in Israel?s campaign to whitewash its crimes and undermine the application of international law to punish these crimes came a few days after the far-right Israeli government publicly blackmailed the PA, demanding that it withdraw its support for adopting the Goldstone report in return for ?permitting? a second mobile communications provider to operate in the occupied Palestinian territory.&#160; It therefore undermines the great efforts by human rights organizations and many activists to bring justice to the Palestinian victims of Israel?s latest massacre in Gaza: the more than 1400 killed (predominantly civilians); the thousands injured; the 1.5 million who are still suffering from the wanton destruction of infrastructure, educational and health institutions, factories, farm lands, power plants, and other critical facilities, and from the long criminal Israeli siege against them. 
It is nothing short of a betrayal of Palestinian civil society?s effective Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel, with all its recent, remarkable growth and achievements in mainstream western societies and among leading unions. 
It is also betrayal of the global solidarity movement that has worked tirelessly and creatively, mainly within the framework of the fast spreading BDS campaign, to end Israel?s impunity and to uphold universal human rights. 
It is crucial to remember that the PA does not have any legal or democratic mandate to speak on behalf of the people of Palestine or to represent the Palestinians at the UN or any of its agencies and institutions.&#160; The current PA government has never won the necessary constitutional approval of the democratically elected Palestinian Legislative Council.&#160; Even if it had such a mandate, at best it would only represent the Palestinians living under Israel?s military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza, excluding the great majority of the people of Palestine, particularly the refugees. 
Only the Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO, can theoretically claim to represent the entirety of the Palestinian people: inside historic Palestine and in exile.&#160; For such a claim to be substantiated and universally accepted by Palestinians everywhere, though, the PLO would need to be revived from the grassroots upwards, in a transparent, democratic and inclusive process that involves Palestinians everywhere and encompasses all the political parties that are outside the PLO structures today.&#160; In parallel with this democratic reclamation or popular take-back of the PLO by the people and their representative unions and institutions, the PA must be responsibly and gradually dismantled, with its current powers, particularly the representation seats at the UN and other regional and international institutions, returned to where they belong, to the real representative of all the people of Palestine, the revived and democratized PLO. &#160;This dissolution of the PA, however, must at all times avoid creating a legal and political vacuum, as history shows that hegemonic powers are often the most likely to fill such a vacuum to the detriment of the oppressed. 
The fact is the PA has been gradually and irreversibly transformed since its establishment 15 years ago from a mere ? often powerless, obsequious and coerced ? sub-contractor of the Israeli occupation regime, relieving it of its most cumbersome civil duties, like the provision of services and tax collection, and, most crucially, very effectively helping it safeguard the security of its occupation army and colonial settlers, into a willing collaborator that constitutes Israel?s most important strategic weapon in countering its growing isolation and loss of legitimacy on the world stage as a colonial and apartheid state.&#160; Israel?s hundreds of nuclear weapons and its fourth largest army in the world proved impotent or at least irrelevant before the growing BDS movement, particularly after Israel?s acts of genocide in Gaza.&#160; The almost unlimited diplomatic, political, economic and scientific support Israel receives from the US and European governments and its unparalleled impunity have also failed to protect it from the gloomy fate of apartheid South Africa. 
Even before Israel?s war on Gaza, many unions around the world had joined the BDS campaign, from Canada to South Africa, and from the UK and Norway to Brazil.&#160; After Gaza, though, the four years of preparing the ground and spreading BDS, the international shock at the sight of Israel?s white phosphorus showers of death visited upon the children of Gaza cowered in UN shelters, and the universal feeling that the international order has failed to hold Israel to account or to even end its slaughter of civilians, not to mention its ongoing ethnic cleansing campaign in the occupied West Bank, particularly in East Jerusalem, BDS leaped into a new, advanced phase.&#160; It finally reached the mainstream. 
In February, weeks after the end of Israel?s bloodbath in Gaza, the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU) made history when it refused to offload an Israeli ship in Durban.&#160; In April, the Scottish Trade Union Congress followed the lead of the South African trade union federation, COSATU, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in adopting BDS against Israel to bring about its compliance with international law.&#160; In May, the University and College Union (UCU), representing some 120,000 British academics, reiterated its annual support for the logic of boycott against Israel, calling for organizing an inter-union BDS conference later this year to discuss effective strategies for implementing the boycott. 
Most recently, this last September, the Norwegian government?s pension fund, the third largest in the world, divested from an Israeli military contractor supplying equipment to the illegal Wall in violation of the ICJ ruling.&#160; Shortly after that, a Spanish ministry excluded an Israeli academic team representing a college illegally built on occupied Palestinian land from participating in an academic competition.&#160; Also in September, the British Trades Union Congress, representing over 6.5 million workers, adopted the boycott, ushering in a new chapter in the spread of BDS that reminds observers of the beginning of the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa.&#160; According to concrete, persistent and mounting indicators, Palestinians are witnessing the arrival of their ?South Africa moment.? 
Amidst all this comes the Goldstone report, quite surprisingly ? given the judge?s strong connections with Israel and Zionism ? providing the straw that may well break the camel?s back: irrefutable evidence, meticulously researched and documented, of Israel?s deliberate commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity.&#160; Despite its clear shortcoming, this report presented Israel with the daunting and not entirely improbable prospect of standing trial at an international tribunal, a development that would effectively end Israel?s impunity and open the possibility of finally applying international justice to its crimes and persistent violations of international law.&#160; In this dire context for Israel, only one strategic weapon in its arsenal could be used to fend off the foretold crushing legal and political defeat: the PA.&#160; And it did use it indeed at the right time, in a fatal way, almost killing the Goldstone report. 
Ultimately, the failure of the UN Human Rights Council to adopt the Goldstone report is another proof, if any is needed, that Palestinians cannot hope at the current historical moment to obtain justice from the US-controlled so-called ?international community.?&#160; Only through intensified, sustainable and context-sensitive civil society campaigns of boycott and divestment can there be any hope that Israel will one day be compelled to end its lawlessness and criminal disregard of human rights and recognize the inalienable Palestinian right to self determination.&#160; This right, as expressed by the great majority of the Palestinian people, comprises ending the occupation, ending the legalized and institutionalized system of racial discrimination, or apartheid, and recognizing the fundamental, UN-sanctioned right of the Palestine refugees to return to their homes of origin, like all other refugees around the world, including Jewish refugees of World War II. 
We simply cannot afford to give up on the UN, though.&#160; Human rights organizations and international civil society must continue to help the Palestinian struggle to pressure the UN, at least its General Assembly, to adopt and act upon the recommendations of the Goldstone report at all levels.&#160; If the UN fails to do so it will send an unambiguous message to Israel that its impunity remains intact and that the international community will stand by apathetically the next time it commits even more egregious crimes against the indigenous people of Palestine. &#160;This would gravely undermine the rule of law and promote in its stead the law of the jungle, where no one will be protected from total chaos and boundless carnage.

&#160;"	"b'<article id=""0413071"" published-at=""2009-10-05"" title=""Dissolve the Palestinian Authority""><p>Palestinian civil society has strongly and almost unanimously condemned the Palestinian Authority?s latest decision to delay adoption by the UN Human Rights Council of the report prepared by the UN Fact-Finding Mission, headed by justice Richard Goldstone, into the recent Israeli war of aggression against the Palestinian people in the occupied Gaza Strip.&amp;#160; A common demand in almost all Palestinian statements issued in this respect was for the UN to adopt the report and act without undue delay on its recommendations in order to bring an end to Israel?s criminal impunity and to hold it accountable before international law for its war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza and, indeed, all over the occupied Palestinian territory.</p> \n<p>Succumbing to US pressures and unabashed Israeli blackmail, the president of the PA himself reportedly was himself responsible for the decision to defer discussion at the Council of the Goldstone report, dashing the hopes of Palestinians everywhere as well as of international human rights organizations and solidarity movements that Israel will finally face a long overdue process of legal accountability and that its victims will have a measure of justice.&amp;#160; This decision by the PA, which in effect delays adoption of the report at least until March 2010, giving Israel a golden opportunity to bury it with US, European, Arab and now Palestinian complicity, constitutes the most blatant case yet of PA betrayal of Palestinian rights and surrender to Israeli dictates.</p> \n<p>This is not the first time, though, that the PA has acted under orders from Washington and threats from Tel Aviv against the express interests of the Palestinian people.&amp;#160; The historic advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in July 2004 that found Israel?s Wall and colonies built on occupied Palestinian territory illegal had presented a rare diplomatic, political and legal opportunity that could have been used to isolate Israel as apartheid South Africa was after a similar ICJ decision in 1971 against its occupation of Namibia.&amp;#160; Alas, the PA squandered it and systematically ? quite suspiciously, actually ? failed to even call on world governments to comply with their obligations stated in the advisory opinion.</p> \n<p>The whole clause on Israel and Palestinian rights that was to be discussed at the recent UN Durban Review Conference in Geneva was dropped after the Palestinian representative gave his green light.&amp;#160; Efforts by non-aligned nations and the former UN General Assembly president, Father Miguel d?Escoto Brockmann, to push for a UN resolution condemning Israel?s war crimes in Gaza and establishing an international tribunal were thwarted mainly by the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, causing several prominent diplomats and international law experts to wonder which side the official Palestinian representative was on.</p> \n<p>The Mercosur-Israel Free Trade Agreement was almost ratified by Brazil this last September after the Palestinian ambassador there expressed approval, only urging Brazil to exclude Israeli settlement products from the Agreement.&amp;#160; With prompt action by Palestinian and Brazilian civil society organizations and eventually by the PLO?s Executive Committee, this ratification was averted and the Brazilian parliamentary committee in charge of this file recommended that the government refrain from approving the FTA until Israel complies with international law.</p> \n<p>In all these cases and many similar ones, the instructions to the Palestinian representatives came from Ramallah, where the PA government has illegally appropriated the PLO powers to lead Palestinian diplomacy and set foreign policy, conceding Palestinian rights and acting against the Palestinian national interests, without worrying about accountability to any elected representatives of the Palestinian people.</p> \n<p>This latest forthright collusion of the PA in Israel?s campaign to whitewash its crimes and undermine the application of international law to punish these crimes came a few days after the far-right Israeli government publicly blackmailed the PA, demanding that it withdraw its support for adopting the Goldstone report in return for ?permitting? a second mobile communications provider to operate in the occupied Palestinian territory.&amp;#160; It therefore undermines the great efforts by human rights organizations and many activists to bring justice to the Palestinian victims of Israel?s latest massacre in Gaza: the more than 1400 killed (predominantly civilians); the thousands injured; the 1.5 million who are still suffering from the wanton destruction of infrastructure, educational and health institutions, factories, farm lands, power plants, and other critical facilities, and from the long criminal Israeli siege against them.</p> \n<p>It is nothing short of a betrayal of Palestinian civil society?s effective Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel, with all its recent, remarkable growth and achievements in mainstream western societies and among leading unions.</p> \n<p>It is also betrayal of the global solidarity movement that has worked tirelessly and creatively, mainly within the framework of the fast spreading BDS campaign, to end Israel?s impunity and to uphold universal human rights.</p> \n<p>It is crucial to remember that the PA does not have any legal or democratic mandate to speak on behalf of the people of Palestine or to represent the Palestinians at the UN or any of its agencies and institutions.&amp;#160; The current PA government has never won the necessary constitutional approval of the democratically elected Palestinian Legislative Council.&amp;#160; Even if it had such a mandate, at best it would only represent the Palestinians living under Israel?s military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza, excluding the great majority of the people of Palestine, particularly the refugees.</p> \n<p>Only the Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO, can theoretically claim to represent the entirety of the Palestinian people: inside historic Palestine and in exile.&amp;#160; For such a claim to be substantiated and universally accepted by Palestinians everywhere, though, the PLO would need to be revived from the grassroots upwards, in a transparent, democratic and inclusive process that involves Palestinians everywhere and encompasses all the political parties that are outside the PLO structures today.&amp;#160; In parallel with this democratic reclamation or popular take-back of the PLO by the people and their representative unions and institutions, the PA must be responsibly and gradually dismantled, with its current powers, particularly the representation seats at the UN and other regional and international institutions, returned to where they belong, to the real representative of all the people of Palestine, the revived and democratized PLO. &amp;#160;This dissolution of the PA, however, must at all times avoid creating a legal and political vacuum, as history shows that hegemonic powers are often the most likely to fill such a vacuum to the detriment of the oppressed.</p> \n<p>The fact is the PA has been gradually and irreversibly transformed since its establishment 15 years ago from a mere ? often powerless, obsequious and coerced ? sub-contractor of the Israeli occupation regime, relieving it of its most cumbersome civil duties, like the provision of services and tax collection, and, most crucially, very effectively helping it safeguard the security of its occupation army and colonial settlers, into a willing collaborator that constitutes Israel?s most important strategic weapon in countering its growing isolation and loss of legitimacy on the world stage as a colonial and apartheid state.&amp;#160; Israel?s hundreds of nuclear weapons and its fourth largest army in the world proved impotent or at least irrelevant before the growing BDS movement, particularly after Israel?s acts of genocide in Gaza.&amp;#160; The almost unlimited diplomatic, political, economic and scientific support Israel receives from the US and European governments and its unparalleled impunity have also failed to protect it from the gloomy fate of apartheid South Africa.</p> \n<p>Even before Israel?s war on Gaza, many unions around the world had joined the BDS campaign, from Canada to South Africa, and from the UK and Norway to Brazil.&amp;#160; After Gaza, though, the four years of preparing the ground and spreading BDS, the international shock at the sight of Israel?s white phosphorus showers of death visited upon the children of Gaza cowered in UN shelters, and the universal feeling that the international order has failed to hold Israel to account or to even end its slaughter of civilians, not to mention its ongoing ethnic cleansing campaign in the occupied West Bank, particularly in East Jerusalem, BDS leaped into a new, advanced phase.&amp;#160; It finally reached the mainstream.</p> \n<p>In February, weeks after the end of Israel?s bloodbath in Gaza, the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU) made history when it refused to offload an Israeli ship in Durban.&amp;#160; In April, the Scottish Trade Union Congress followed the lead of the South African trade union federation, COSATU, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in adopting BDS against Israel to bring about its compliance with international law.&amp;#160; In May, the University and College Union (UCU), representing some 120,000 British academics, reiterated its annual support for the logic of boycott against Israel, calling for organizing an inter-union BDS conference later this year to discuss effective strategies for implementing the boycott.</p> \n<p>Most recently, this last September, the Norwegian government?s pension fund, the third largest in the world, divested from an Israeli military contractor supplying equipment to the illegal Wall in violation of the ICJ ruling.&amp;#160; Shortly after that, a Spanish ministry excluded an Israeli academic team representing a college illegally built on occupied Palestinian land from participating in an academic competition.&amp;#160; Also in September, the British Trades Union Congress, representing over 6.5 million workers, adopted the boycott, ushering in a new chapter in the spread of BDS that reminds observers of the beginning of the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa.&amp;#160; According to concrete, persistent and mounting indicators, Palestinians are witnessing the arrival of their ?South Africa moment.?</p> \n<p>Amidst all this comes the Goldstone report, quite surprisingly ?

110206	1398206	TRUE	left	https://counterpunch.org/2010/09/24/why-mitchell-said-quot-no-quot-to-hamas/	publisher	https://counterpunch.org/	2010-09-24	"Why Mitchell Said ""No"" to Hamas"	"One key difference between Hamas and its rival, the Fatah movement in the West Bank, is that Hamas is accountable to a much more complex set of priorities and expectations. While Fatah is effortlessly co-opted, Hamas remains confined by ideological standards and the stringiest political space. Although, on one hand this represents Hamas? greatest strength, on the other it shows just how truly arduous is its political undertaking. 
The difference is relevant in light of the resumption of talks between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, followed by another round of talks in the Middle East. Both once more raised the question: can Israel and Fatah achieve peace without Hamas? involvement? 
The question itself can be interpreted in more ways than one. Dan Murphy, writing in the Christian Science Monitor on September 16, asked: Can ignoring Hamas lead to Israeli-Palestinian peace? Murphy, unlike many in the US media, had enough insight to see the issue as worthy of discussion. His use of the word ?ignoring?, however, is greatly misguided. 
?But there?s a crucial missing element that will undoubtedly trouble the Israeli-Palestinian talks as they move ahead. Gaza, the Palestinian enclave ruled by the Islamist Hamas movement, is not at the table,? Murphy wrote. With that he offered his version of what not ?ignoring? Hamas requires. Far from ?engaging? the party, it simply means placing Gaza, that lonely enclave ruled by Islamic Hamas, on the table. 
Gaza, however, is not merely one issue among many. It represents the heart of the matter. The Gaza Strip was placed under siege due to the Hamas? victory in the 2006 parliamentary elections, which robbed Abbas and his movement from any legitimacy in holding negotiations with Israel. The suffocating siege on that resilient and overcrowded strip was Israel?s attempt at quashing what could have been a promising democratic experience, with the potential to inspire many more democratic revolutions in the Middle East. Israel?s action was supported by the US and much of Europe, as well as some Arab countries. 
Yet, considering the layers of meaning that Gaza and Hamas represent in any future settlement in the Middle East, it seems utterly bizarre that US President Obama?s Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, answered with a simple ?no? when he was recently asked whether Washington will reach out to Hamas. 
?No? seems both too simple and too harsh, considering the gravity of the situation. Even if the US administration wishes to write off Palestinian democracy altogether, one would think that a sensible foreign policy would at least wrangle with the Hamas dilemma. The Obama administration cannot be serious about a lasting peace while continuing to play the same nonsensical good guys/bad guys, carrot and stick political games that were also employed by Bush. 
On the other hand, the resumption of talks between Fatah?s Abbas and Israel is a blessing in disguise for Hamas. Very few in the Middle East, and even fewer Palestinians will see in Abbas a legitimate and representative leader. If anything, Abbas? constant appearance with the very Israeli leader who is robbing Palestine?s land and subjugating and exacting racist laws against its population will further diminish his discredited profile. Naturally, Abbas? political loss is Hamas? gain. 
In fact, it was this very ?peace process? that destroyed late Palestinian leader Yasser?s Arafat?s political resume. It tarnished his reputation and split his party. Arafat is remembered fondly because of his last stance and death under Israeli siege in Ramallah. His political failure through the years, however, gave Hamas its real birth as a mainstream political movement. Abbas is simply boosting Hamas? already high political stocks. His future failures will deposit even more credit into Hamas? account. 
But that too represents a serious challenge to Hamas. Politically isolated abroad, physically besieged and constantly derided by the media, Hamas can hardly use its rising political profile among Palestinians, or translate its gains into any tangible returns in or outside Palestine. Abbas knows this fully, which explains his interest in Israel maintaining its siege on Hamas and Gaza. Netanyahu understands this as well, which explains his government?s insistence on holding still, despite the PR disaster that Gaza has earned his country. The US also fully agrees, thus Mitchell?s callous, yet telling ?no? regarding a possible engagement with Hamas. 
Abbas, despite his authority?s lack of legitimacy and shrinking popularity among Palestinians, remains the best option of a ?Palestinian leadership? as far as the US is concerned. He is flexible, both morally and politically. His Authority?s bread and butter are US funds and US-Western political validation. Abbas gleaned from the Gaza experience that popular democracy is worthless in the age of draconian sieges and Blitzkriegs. In fact he used both the siege and the Israel war on Gaza to strengthen his political stance and to bargain with the US. But his language and action will remain predictable. 
While ?engaging? Hamas, however that is interpreted, is the only right option if the US is truly interested in locating a legitimate Palestinian leadership, Hamas is likely to prove a much tougher bargainer. Not only is Hamas ideologically grounded ? based on firm nationalistic and religious dictates ? but its target audience is not just a few heads of states. Hamas? audience is Palestinians at home and abroad, Arab and Muslim populations and to lesser degree civil societies elsewhere. This is a complex demographic, which requires an articulate political thinking and language, which Hamas is not yet able to offer. 
Fatah under Arafat was held accountable largely to Arab governments, and later to the US and Western donors. At the same time, it valiantly resented Israeli pressures. Under Abbas, Fatah is held accountable to all the above with little resentment. While Hamas factors all of these players into its political calculation, it is also liable to its commitment to its Palestinian constituency as incorruptible, uncompromising and committed to resistance. 
In order for Hamas to become politically manageable, from the US point of view, it would have to depart from these commitments, and become as politically flexible, predictable and controllable as Fatah and Abbas. The US can only work with a weak Palestinian leadership which it can easily manipulate. Hamas, thus far, doesn?t fit the criterion, thus the lack of any prospect of ?engagement?, and the continued betting on Abbas and Netanyahu, despite the predictable ? and possibly disastrous ? outcome of their talks.

The protests that have rocked Italian universities over the past week show no sign of ending. In fact, the movement against reforms proposed by the Minister of Education, Letizia Moratti, to change the Italian educational system and admissions process, blocked the beginning of the academic year at many campuses and in some case resulted in the first occupations of university buildings. 
The demonstrations organized by the l?Unione degli Studenti, the Union of the Students that is connected to Democratici di Sinistra; Studenti di Sinistra, the Student Left that is associated with Rifondazione Comunista and Rete Studenti, Student Network that has a legacy with left squatter community centers, gaining the support of all the student associations as well. The main protests have been centered in Rome, but demonstrations have taken place in over 70 cities including Milan, Palermo, Trieste, Florence and Naples. The organizers estimate that as many as 250,000 students have participated in protests and other action over the last several days. On Tuesday, symbolic occupations began in the physics department in Rome and the mathematics department in Florence. Then on Wednesday, 20,000 demonstrated in Palermo in piazza Indipendenza, 20,000 in Rome in piazza della Republica and 10,000 in Milan against ?the political privatization of schools and of knowledge?. 
Teachers have also also played a prominent role in the revolt against the government reforms. Nunzio Miraglia, the national coordinator of the Association of University Teachers, exclaimed: ?the protests of this week are the best answer to a minister who says she has the good of the university in mind The university is under attack, finally students discuss with us and they expect more from an institution and that it be democratic.? 
The government reforms will create eight liceo or secondary schools: classic, scientific, language, artistic, human sciences, technical, musical and economic. The professional institutes would then be entrusted to the regions with four obligatory years and a fifth optional one. The opposition to the reforms is rooted in the fact that they will clearly divide whose who will attend liceo, the stepping stone for entrance into the university system and whose who will go to professional institutes. The continued mobilizations of students across Italy are to make sure that that this does not become a reality. 
The demonstrators have opened a debate beyond the proposed reforms that has begun to start a discussion about the function of the public university and its future in Italy. In opposition to Moratti?s proposed reforms, they are demanding: 1. The implementation of obligatory scholarships until age 18. 2. Institution of a national law stating the right to study and to total access to knowledge. 3. Reform of the national and peripheral collegiate organs in order to guarantee greater democracy and participation of the students in the instruction. 
However, in spite of mobilizations across the country, the demonstrators still face an uphill battle. Even in the face of national pressure expressed repeatedly by students and teachers, Moratti continues to seem intent on going ahead with the government reforms.

The main protests have been centered in Rome, but demonstrations have taken place in over 70 cities including Milan, Palermo, Trieste, Florence and Naples. The organizers estimate that as many as 250,000 students have participated in protests and other action over the last several days. On Tuesday, symbolic occupations began in the physics department in Rome and the mathematics department in Florence. Then on Wednesday, 20,000 demonstrated in Palermo in piazza Indipendenza, 20,000 in Rome in piazza della Republica and 10,000 in Milan against ?the political privatization of schools and of knowledge?.</p> \n<p>Teachers have also also played a prominent role in the revolt against the government reforms. Nunzio Miraglia, the national coordinator of the Association of University Teachers, exclaimed: ?the protests of this week are the best answer to a minister who says she has the good of the university in mind The university is under attack, finally students discuss with us and they expect more from an institution and that it be democratic.?</p> \n<p>The government reforms will create eight liceo or secondary schools: classic, scientific, language, artistic, human sciences, technical, musical and economic. The professional institutes would then be entrusted to the regions with four obligatory years and a fifth optional one. The opposition to the reforms is rooted in the fact that they will clearly divide whose who will attend liceo, the stepping stone for entrance into the university system and whose who will go to professional institutes. The continued mobilizations of students across Italy are to make sure that that this does not become a reality.</p> \n<p>The demonstrators have opened a debate beyond the proposed reforms that has begun to start a discussion about the function of the public university and its future in Italy. In opposition to Moratti?s proposed reforms, they are demanding: 1. The implementation of obligatory scholarships until age 18. 2. Institution of a national law stating the right to study and to total access to knowledge. 3. Reform of the national and peripheral collegiate organs in order to guarantee greater democracy and participation of the students in the instruction.</p> \n<p>However, in spite of mobilizations across the country, the demonstrators still face an uphill battle. Even in the face of national pressure expressed repeatedly by students and teachers, Moratti continues to seem intent on going ahead with the government reforms.</p> \n<p>KATRINA YEAW is a member of Students Against War, a chapter of the Campus Antiwar Network, at San Francisco State University.

The animation powerhouse?s 19th film brims with Pixar?s signature melancholy, imagination, and breathtaking visual invention. It?s also the first to star a protagonist of color, a charmingly gutsy Mexican boy named Miguel, and voiced by a majority Latinx cast. 
It isn?t the first animated children?s movie of the last few years to do so, or to base its story on the Mexican traditions of D?a de los Muertos (2014?s Book of Life beat it to the punch), but its heartfelt message about remembrance, its neon-colored whimsy, and its commitment to meticulously researched cultural authenticity make it one of the best this year?not to mention one of glaringly few instances of Hollywood representation that doesn?t require Mexican-Americans to cringe, settle for scraps, or turn a blind eye to tone-deaf stereotypes.&#160; 
It does come with caveats, however. There are startlingly frank ideas about death and loss detonating quietly in the midst of Coco?s slapstick, building to an emotional swell that triggers waterworks in that surefire Pixar way. But a bit too much of Coco?s story, in fact, relies on what Pixar is already known for. Certain through lines feel a bit copy-paste, hitting recognizable beats that veer on predictability. For a film that is otherwise groundbreaking, that?s a shame. 
A hero is barred by society from pursuing their dream but, through the power of belief, self-actualization?and a healthy dose of Magic Feather Syndrome?they overcome. In this case our hero is 12-year-old Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez, stellar in his feature debut), whose family has weathered a generations-long ban on music. That means no playing instruments, singing, or even associating with musicians. It?s weird. And a tough break for Miguel, whose greatest aspiration is, naturally, to take the stage and sing like his musical hero Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), the ?greatest musician of all time? who was smushed to death by a giant bell years ago. 
The film?s opening sequence offers an inventive, if overlong, look back at the ban?s origins through animated papel picado. Miguel?s great-great-grandfather, an aspiring musician, abandoned his wife Imelda (Alanna Ubach) and their baby daughter (the titular Coco) in pursuit of stardom. Left heartbroken and reeling, Imelda shut music out of her life, forbade her family from it forevermore and founded the shoemaking business Miguel is so desperate not to inherit. 
He?d rather steal away and practice guitar in secret, hoping to enter his town?s talent contest on D?a de los Muertos, a day of remembrance when families set up photos of departed relatives on ofrendas, thus (in the film?s version of the tradition anyway) allowing their spirits a one-night ticket to visit the living and pick up their offerings. Miguel learns the hard way what it means to cross your abuela on a family-oriented holiday (a Latinx kid rite of passage, basically) when she learns of his plans and smashes his only guitar. 
Desperate to enter the contest anyway, Miguel breaks into de la Cruz?s tomb and borrows his famed guitar. Somehow, the disturbance knocks Miguel into a realm where he can see the spirits of the dead?animated as bumbling, cuddly skeletons?and cross over to the dazzlingly colorful Land of the Dead. 
It?s a long, laborious setup for the moment he sets foot there; 20 to 30 minutes of near-constant exposition. But the second he does, the film finally crackles to life, erupting into songs composed by Frozen?s Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez (whose centerpiece song ?Remember Me? is gorgeously rendered as both a corrido-style ballad and a gentle, heartbreaking lullaby) and kicking off a mystery-adventure about the identity of Miguel?s great-great-grandfather. 
Miguel?s quest to secure a deceased family member?s blessing to return to his world and play music surfaces unexpectedly complex ideas. There?s a class system-like separation between spirits whose families still place their pictures on ofrendas and those who do not. H?ctor (Gael Garc?a Bernal, impossibly charming even offscreen) is a spirit almost forgotten. As Miguel teams up with him to find de la Cruz, whom he?s convinced must be his ancestor, we learn saddening details of H?ctor?s life after death. 
He lives in a kind of shadow community under the bustling party-lit thoroughfares with other spirits barred from crossing over. His existence is defined by desperation?not only in his futile mission to sneak back to the land of the living for one night, but also in the knowledge that soon, when the last living person on earth forgets him, he will crumble into dust and cease to exist. 
It?s a heavy concept for a kid?s movie, one we witness play out with another spirit. But it?s also what lends the film?s message about the value of holding onto memories, both good and bad, for the sake of preserving history its urgency. 
Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast. 
A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't). 
There?s even a strangely timely lesson about celebrity hero worship buried in Coco, touching on the terrible things beloved, successful people often do to get ahead. These insights are left half-baked in favor of circling back to the film?s central plot?reuniting Miguel with his family and reiterating his commitment to music?but they are at least glimmers of provocation accompanying all that stunning imagery. (The eye-popping, folk art-inspired alebrijes, magical creatures in the Land of the Dead, will emerge as fan favorites.) 
For a film plagued by controversy from the start, however, Coco emerges relatively unscathed. 
Disney blundered its way into the bad graces of Mexican-Americans with a 2013 attempt to trademark the phrase ?D?a de los Muertos,? then the working title for the film. It didn?t help that the only name attached to the project at the time was director Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3), a white guy from outside Cleveland. 
Commendably, Pixar learned from the mistake. It promoted storyboard artist Adrian Molina, who penned the script, to co-director and cultivated a group of cultural consultants including Mexican-American cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz and playwright Octavio Solis. (Even now, on the eve of release, Coco is dogged by bad news: explosive allegations of misconduct against Pixar head John Lasseter, an executive producer on the film.) 
Still, I?ll admit to feeling uneasy before watching to see how a real, complicated country full of real, complicated people?one half my family hails from?would be cartoonified and presented with the same gee-whiz wonder that Pixar usually reserves for unseen or fantastical worlds: oceans of talking fish, realms of monsters, societies of toys or rats or cars. 
But exoticization, it turns out, is not the problem. The film?s version of Mexico is lovingly rendered and full of small nods to recognizable facets of everyday life. Characters slip in and out of Spanish in a way familiar to many Mexican Americans; close-knit multigenerational families are the norm. They even allude to an ingrained fear of our matriarchs? chanclas. 
And yet, it never quite comes fully alive?at least, ironically, not until after Miguel has crossed to the Land of the Dead. That the town-set chapters of the film are burdened with exposition might be one factor. But perhaps another is the over-familiarity of its setup, a standard-issue Pixar story template. 
The film?s approach to Miguel?s forbidden love of music echoes the ?you can do anything!? ethos of Ratatouille, Monsters University, Brave, and non-Pixar kids? movies all over the map, from Kung-Fu Panda to Turbo. It is, by now, a bit trite. 
Coco?s attention to detail shines brightest when the film delves beyond what Americans already most closely associate with Mexican culture (pi?atas, pan dulce, Frida Kahlo) and spotlights under-recognized hallmarks like the country?s Golden Age of cinema, here reflected in black-and-white scenes starring de la Cruz, a singer and movie star modeled after mid-century icons like Pedro Infante, Javier Solis, and Jorge Negrete. 
The film?s greatest moment comes when Miguel belts out the chorus to ?Un Poco Loco,? a showstopper written in a folk musical style native to the state of Veracruz. (The most famous son jarocho example before this was ?La Bamba.?) That is something more akin to specificity. 
It?s in moments like that that the film buzzes to life and becomes something special?a memory worth passing down to the next generation."

122647	506106	TRUE	left	https://truthdig.com/articles/a-countercultural-conversation-with-noam-chomsky/	publisher	https://truthdig.com/	2010-08-06	A Countercultural Conversation With Noam Chomsky	"The following is an interview with professor Noam Chomsky that was conducted on June 19, 2008 (the 126th anniversary of the invention of American baseball and on what would have been Moe Howard?s 111th birthday), at MIT in Cambridge. The purpose of our conversation was to examine (for a graphic memoir/critique of contemporary culture that I?d just begun working on) the question of why the counterculture, which had been so endemic to the politics of dissent in the 1950s, ?60s and ?70s, no longer seemed to exist in any viable way. Having used only a small portion of our talk for my book, I felt that the complete exchange was sufficiently interesting to offer up to those who, like me, consider professor Chomsky to be, all by himself, The Beatles of all smart guys, with every interview that he participates in between the publication of his books being the equivalent of Beatle bootlegs, fascinating in their improvised eloquence and revelatory in their matter-of-factness.Mr. Fish: 
I?ve already talked to people like Mort Sahl, Paul Krassner, Victor Navasky, people like that, to find out why there seems to be fewer artists and public intellectuals creating art and social commentary that inspires people to conceptualize a worldview [that is able to exist] contrary to the one offered by the dominant culture. I?m trying to find out why we no longer seem capable of creating art that is sufficiently weaponized to combat and inflict real damage to those values that seem more interested in maintaining the status quo ? values that may be counterintuitive to our survival as a free society. Before I go on, do you perceive a change? 
Noam Chomsky: No, not particularly. There are probably more critics today than there were in the past. 
MF: In the arts? 
 
 
NC: Well, who are the public intellectuals who people talk about in the past ? the dissident public intellectuals? 
MF: People like [Norman] Mailer, [Kurt] Vonnegut. 
NC: They were fine, but they were novelists. They said almost nothing about public events. I mean, yeah, Norman Mailer, I knew him ? he would write an article every now and then, a pretty good article, but I don?t think it comes anywhere near to what Norman Solomon does. 
MF: Yeah, but when you compare audiences, more people know who Norman Mailer is than Norman Solomon. 
NC: Because he was a novelist and one who put himself in the public eye, so he was something of a showman. That doesn?t mean he was reaching anybody with his political views. The fact that he knifed his wife may have put him on the front pages, but it didn?t change anybody?s political views. 
MF: He changed mine. I mean, in a society gripped by [political correctness], public urination can be a political act. 
NC: I wouldn?t call him a public intellectual. I?m glad he was around and did some of the things he did. In fact, the best book of his that I know of, that I read, was ?Armies of the Night,? and that was his single foray into political activism. 
MF: Well, that?s not completely true. There was ?The Prisoner of Sex,? ?The White Negro,? his coverage of political conventions. ? 
NC: Covering conventions isn?t dissident journalism. That?s playing a role in creating illusions about how the political system functions. 
MF: Actually, when it?s done by somebody like Mailer, it?s a piece of writing that explores the humanity of the event, the fallibility of the players, and turns it into a debate that can take place in public, where it can then grow into a conversation and inspire some deeper understanding [of the event]. 
NC: If that?s what a public intellectual is then I think we have plenty more of them today. I think they?re just illusions about the past. The fact of the matter is that, when you look over time, intellectuals, by and large, are servants of power. There are very few exceptions to that and the exceptions are usually punished one way or another. We think about the Dreyfus Affair and the great intellectuals, they were a small minority. The mass of French intellectuals supported the state. 
MF: Was that more about some form of academic freedom than artistic freedom? Are they more or less the same thing? 
NC: There are always attacks on academic freedom, but I think it?s better protected now than it has been in the past. There is repression and [there are] bad things that happen, but if you look over time it?s nothing like what it?s been in the past. I mean, take surveillance, let?s say, bad thing. What was in the ?60s? The FBI was all over the place, the Army had surveillance systems, the CIA had surveillance, way more than what it is now. Now you can do things with electronic surveillance, OK, big deal. I was active in the resistance and took for granted that the phone was probably tapped, but it never constrained us. If you had to do something that you didn?t want the FBI to hear, you did it privately. Everybody knew that whatever group you were in was infiltrated, and you could usually guess who the infiltrators were, but if you wanted to do something serious, say help a deserter, you did it with an affinity group. If you think about repression, as bad as it may be today, it doesn?t even come close to COINTELPRO. That was running through four administrations ? mainly Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, where it was stopped ? and it went all the way to political assassination. Is that happening now? 
MF: Depends on who you ask, I guess. 
NC: And [Woodrow] Wilson?s Red Scare made it all look tame. So, sure, bad things are happening, but we shouldn?t exaggerate. There have been a lot of gains. 
MF: Still, and getting back to my point about the mollification of the artistic community, there seems to be fewer and fewer expectations that an artist will or even should engage in world politics. 
NC: Expectations from whom? 
MF: From the public, the dominant culture, the government, certainly. 
NC: The corporate media aren?t going to encourage them to be subversive, but has that ever been the case for art? 
MF: No, but the amount of discouragement from the private sector seems new. At one time, it wasn?t so outlandish for a person to say that he or she wanted to become a painter or a novelist or a playwright ? it was a lifestyle, in fact, that suggested its own spiritual reward, and politics was traditionally considered to be part of the lifestyle, usually dissent. 
NC: But that?s a different kind of change. The freelance intellectuals, whatever they were, the writers and artists, over the years have drifted towards institutions, so now instead of being a [full-time] novelist you?ll be a novelist on the side and teaching creative writing at the university. That wasn?t an option in the ?40s and ?50s. 
MF: And that?s the loss, the sidelining of passion, of truth-seeking. 
NC: Well, it?s an institutional change. To some people it may have restrictive consequences, maybe impose internal conditions on the work they do, but it certainly doesn?t have to. 
MF: But it always will. Consider the size and makeup of the two audiences: an instructor in a classroom writing part time versus a full-time writer whose celebrity comes from a full-time writing career [that?s] lived large in the public eye. 
NC: Give talks. I spend half my life just giving talks. 
MF: But that?s not novel writing. 
NC: Still, being at the university gives you tremendous privilege. If you want to use it, you can use it. It?s a lot more privilege than if you?re in a loft somewhere trying to get enough money for the next meal. 
MF: Ah, but that?s so romantic. 
NC: Sounds romantic, unless you?re living it. ?La Boh?me? doesn?t have a happy ending. MF: All right, let?s step away from the individual expression of art for a moment and get back to the corporate sort ? the sort written in high-rise office buildings by committee and not in lofts by one person. When you consider some of the shows that appeared on network television in the ?60s and ?70s? shows like ?All in the Family,? ?Free to Be You and Me,? ?Laugh-In,? ?That Was the Week That Was,? ?The Smothers Brothers,? shows that would never appear outside of cable television today because they?d be considered too dangerous ? is it not easy to see that there?s been a cultural shift in the wrong direction? 
NC: Well, there are commercial pressures within commercial institutions. That?s not a big surprise. 
MF: The question is what happens over time? Doesn?t the integrity of the art degrade when no new ideas are allowed to flourish? 
NC: I?ll occasionally look at an old movie from the ?40s and it?s kind of fun because I remember them from when I was a kid, but you couldn?t really call them high art. The actors were very wooden, there?s no storyline. It?s fun to watch Cary Grant and Greta Garbo and people like that ?Humphrey Bogart was fun, but he wasn?t subversive. 
MF: In all fairness, though, the job of cinema back then was different. [Drama] was exaggerated to serve the artistry of the craft more than to mirror reality, which is more subtle ? duller even. You don?t go to a ballet and then ridicule the dancers because you don?t see people walking down the street like that. 
NC: This is really an area that I really can?t comment on. I really don?t know enough. I don?t watch television, but I?d be surprised if there were major differences between then and now. 
MF: There is really a certain amount of sameness [in commercial entertainment], but the differences are glaring and I don?t think I?m over-romanticizing the time period. 
NC: When my wife and I were college students we were movie fans and we?d go down to New York and watch movies, but they were foreign movies. We?d watch ?The Bicycle Thief? and that sort of thing. We didn?t have much time for American movies. 
MF: Well, with the possible exception of Orson Welles and a few others, once you get past the ?40s and early ?50s, there was an attempt from guys like Mike Nichols and even Peter Fonda to sort of Europeanize American cinema, to tinker with different concepts of heroism. 
NC: Did it reach mainstream cinema? 
MF: Oh, yeah. If you look at ?Catch 22,? based on the Heller book, or even ?The Graduate?. ? 
NC: Yeah, I saw it, but only because I had a friend who had a part in it. 
MF: Really? 
NC: Remember at the end when the protagonist stops at a gas station? 
MF: He was the gas station guy? 
NC: He was the gas station guy. It made his career, one line. 
MF: ?Need any gas, Father?!? 
NC: He was a kid I grew up with. But take that film. Is that what?s regarded as an innovative, exciting film? I mean, Dustin Hoffman is a great actor and I love to watch him, but what was the message of the film? 
"	"b'<article id=""0506106"" published-at=""2010-08-06"" title=""A Countercultural Conversation With Noam Chomsky""><p>The following is an interview with professor Noam Chomsky that was conducted on June 19, 2008 (the 126th anniversary of the invention of American baseball and on what would have been Moe Howard?s 111th birthday), at MIT in Cambridge. The purpose of our conversation was to examine (for a graphic memoir/critique of contemporary culture that I?d just begun working on) the question of why the counterculture, which had been so endemic to the politics of dissent in the 1950s, ?60s and ?70s, no longer seemed to exist in any viable way. Having used only a small portion of our talk for my book, I felt that the complete exchange was sufficiently interesting to offer up to those who, like me, consider professor Chomsky to be, all by himself, The Beatles of all smart guys, with every interview that he participates in between the publication of his books being the equivalent of Beatle bootlegs, fascinating in their improvised eloquence and revelatory in their matter-of-factness.Mr. Fish:</p> \n<p>I?ve already talked to people like Mort Sahl, Paul Krassner, Victor Navasky, people like that, to find out why there seems to be fewer artists and public intellectuals creating art and social commentary that inspires people to conceptualize a worldview [that is able to exist] contrary to the one offered by the dominant culture. I?m trying to find out why we no longer seem capable of creating art that is sufficiently weaponized to combat and inflict real damage to those values that seem more interested in maintaining the status quo ? values that may be counterintuitive to our survival as a free society. Before I go on, do you perceive a change?</p> \n<p>Noam Chomsky: No, not particularly. There are probably more critics today than there were in the past.</p> \n<p>MF: In the arts?</p> \n<p /> \n<p /> \n<p>NC: Well, who are the public intellectuals who people talk about in the past ? the dissident public intellectuals?</p> \n<p>MF: People like [Norman] Mailer, [Kurt] Vonnegut.</p> \n<p>NC: They were fine, but they were novelists. They said almost nothing about public events. I mean, yeah, Norman Mailer, I knew him ? he would write an article every now and then, a pretty good article, but I don?t think it comes anywhere near to what Norman Solomon does.</p> \n<p>MF: Yeah, but when you compare audiences, more people know who Norman Mailer is than Norman Solomon.</p> \n<p>NC: Because he was a novelist and one who put himself in the public eye, so he was something of a showman. That doesn?t mean he was reaching anybody with his political views. The fact that he knifed his wife may have put him on the front pages, but it didn?t change anybody?s political views.</p> \n<p>MF: He changed mine. I mean, in a society gripped by [political correctness], public urination can be a political act.</p> \n<p>NC: I wouldn?t call him a public intellectual. I?m glad he was around and did some of the things he did. In fact, the best book of his that I know of, that I read, was ?Armies of the Night,? and that was his single foray into political activism.</p> \n<p>MF: Well, that?s not completely true. There was ?The Prisoner of Sex,? ?The White Negro,? his coverage of political conventions. ?</p> \n<p>NC: Covering conventions isn?t dissident journalism. That?s playing a role in creating illusions about how the political system functions.</p> \n<p>MF: Actually, when it?s done by somebody like Mailer, it?s a piece of writing that explores the humanity of the event, the fallibility of the players, and turns it into a debate that can take place in public, where it can then grow into a conversation and inspire some deeper understanding [of the event].</p> \n<p>NC: If that?s what a public intellectual is then I think we have plenty more of them today. I think they?re just illusions about the past. The fact of the matter is that, when you look over time, intellectuals, by and large, are servants of power. There are very few exceptions to that and the exceptions are usually punished one way or another. We think about the Dreyfus Affair and the great intellectuals, they were a small minority. The mass of French intellectuals supported the state.</p> \n<p>MF: Was that more about some form of academic freedom than artistic freedom? Are they more or less the same thing?</p> \n<p>NC: There are always attacks on academic freedom, but I think it?s better protected now than it has been in the past. There is repression and [there are] bad things that happen, but if you look over time it?s nothing like what it?s been in the past. I mean, take surveillance, let?s say, bad thing. What was in the ?60s? The FBI was all over the place, the Army had surveillance systems, the CIA had surveillance, way more than what it is now. Now you can do things with electronic surveillance, OK, big deal. I was active in the resistance and took for granted that the phone was probably tapped, but it never constrained us. If you had to do something that you didn?t want the FBI to hear, you did it privately. Everybody knew that whatever group you were in was infiltrated, and you could usually guess who the infiltrators were, but if you wanted to do something serious, say help a deserter, you did it with an affinity group. If you think about repression, as bad as it may be today, it doesn?t even come close to COINTELPRO. That was running through four administrations ? mainly Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, where it was stopped ? and it went all the way to political assassination. Is that happening now?</p> \n<p>MF: Depends on who you ask, I guess.</p> \n<p>NC: And [Woodrow] Wilson?s Red Scare made it all look tame. So, sure, bad things are happening, but we shouldn?t exaggerate. There have been a lot of gains.</p> \n<p>MF: Still, and getting back to my point about the mollification of the artistic community, there seems to be fewer and fewer expectations that an artist will or even should engage in world politics.</p> \n<p>NC: Expectations from whom?</p> \n<p>MF: From the public, the dominant culture, the government, certainly.</p> \n<p>NC: The corporate media aren?t going to encourage them to be subversive, but has that ever been the case for art?</p> \n<p>MF: No, but the amount of discouragement from the private sector seems new. At one time, it wasn?t so outlandish for a person to say that he or she wanted to become a painter or a novelist or a playwright ? it was a lifestyle, in fact, that suggested its own spiritual reward, and politics was traditionally considered to be part of the lifestyle, usually dissent.</p> \n<p>NC: But that?s a different kind of change. The freelance intellectuals, whatever they were, the writers and artists, over the years have drifted towards institutions, so now instead of being a [full-time] novelist you?ll be a novelist on the side and teaching creative writing at the university. That wasn?t an option in the ?40s and ?50s.</p> \n<p>MF: And that?s the loss, the sidelining of passion, of truth-seeking.</p> \n<p>NC: Well, it?s an institutional change. To some people it may have restrictive consequences, maybe impose internal conditions on the work they do, but it certainly doesn?t have to.</p> \n<p>MF: But it always will. Consider the size and makeup of the two audiences: an instructor in a classroom writing part time versus a full-time writer whose celebrity comes from a full-time writing career [that?s] lived large in the public eye.</p> \n<p>NC: Give talks. I spend half my life just giving talks.</p> \n<p>MF: But that?s not novel writing.</p> \n<p>NC: Still, being at the university gives you tremendous privilege. If you want to use it, you can use it.

Rather than actually consider the extreme torture and grizzly slaughter of animals perpetrated by humans, Kinkaid seems wedded to the standard tactics of other animal oppressors ? basing his attack solely on innuendo, deflection, guilt by association, and flat out falsehoods. 
The very title of the article implies that Davis?s veganism is some new whim she?s seized onto in order to gain relevance. In fact, Davis first alluded to her veganism as far back as 2012 in a speech at the Empowering Women of Color Conference, where she stated that animal liberation is inextricably interwoven with other anti-oppression movements. She simply doesn?t talk much about it, she said. 
By implying that Davis has only recently ?gone vegan,? Kinkaid uses the tried and true approach of distracting from the issue at hand ? the plight of non-human animals, who die by the hundreds of billions each year thanks to uncontrollable human greed and bloodlust. Kinkaid?s smears don?t stop there. He goes on to list a litany of causes Davis is connected with: communism, Islam, Black Lives Matter, prison abolition, and anti-capitalism. He even goes so far as to call Davis PETA?s new poster-child; PETA, an organization he says ?places the rights of animals above human needs,? a laughable claim to anyone remotely familiar with PETA. By spending most of his article tying Davis to movements and entities Kinkaid considers disreputable, Kinkaid hopes the reader?s takeaway about animal liberation and veganism will remain obscured and uninformed. 
Kinkaid?s broadside against Davis really isn?t anything to write home about, though. His brand of obfuscation is yet one more contribution to a repugnant and repressive anti-animal worldview held by the masses. Kinkaid, however distasteful his Professional Patriot shtick, presents what?s basically the same smokescreen-as-justification that most readers of this article do themselves at the dinner table each night. 
Kinkaid?s purposeful ignorance of the injustice done to animals ? the routinized beating, knifing, raping, burning, boiling, skinning, electrocution and countless other modes of torture and dominance employed ? is to be expected. Nobody should be surprised by a racist, climate denying, pro-war, Christian fundamentalist, covering up atrocities against animals. But for anarchists, libertarians, progressives and others of the Left, partaking in or making excuses for the unspeakable crimes committed against animals ? who have an interest in their continued existence, their families, and their habitats ? is utterly beyond the pale. For those who claim to be passionate about justice for all, while at the same time contributing to the mass slaughter of animals, shame on you.

Evan McMullin, 40, is a former CIA operative who was once the chief policy director of the House Republican Conference ? but he decided to leave the party after he realized the GOP's problems ""are too deep"" to resolve in this generation's lifetime, he told NBC News. 
His platform is based on differentiating himself from the main-party candidates, who he argues are more similar than they are different from each other. 
""The short-hand is I believe both Trump and Clinton are from the left side of the political spectrum in most ways,"" he said. ""Both want to grow the size of the government. I'm the only conservative in this race. I favor a limited government."" 
His alternative governing views, and his Mormon faith, have attracted so much support among Utah voters that in a survey conducted earlier this week by Salt Lake City-based Y2 Analytics, McMullin was in a statistical tie with Trump and Clinton. 
The survey, conducted after lewd comments made by Trump in 2005 surfaced, showed Clinton and Trump tied at 26 percent, McMullin with 22 percent, and Libertarian Gary Johnson holding steady at 14 percent, according to Utah's Deseret News. 
The support, McMullin said, is as much about his policies compared to Clintons' and Trump's as it is about his character. 
""I think the American people know that both of these options are awful, and they're looking for something better. That [Trump] tape really crystallized that sentiment for a lot of people. I consider myself the opposite of Trump in a lot of ways, both in terms of a lot of policies, and in terms of temperament and judgment,"" he said. 
McMullin, along with his running mate Mindy Finn, doesn't have much of a shot at actually getting elected ? he's only on the ballot in 11 states and a write-in option in 23 others ? but political experts say his rise in Utah is notable.

""This is completely different than anything we've ever seen,"" Christopher Karpowitz, co-director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University, told NBC News. ""I think there is just widespread frustration with Donald Trump and really with both of the candidates from the two major parties, so Utahns, including many who have typically voted Republican, are casting about for some other alternative."" 
McMullin, Karpowitz added, fits a ""particular set of needs in this state: people who don't feel like they can in good conscience vote for Trump, but they're not ready to vote for Hillary Clinton, either."" 
But political watchers aren't ready to predict a win for McMullin in Utah, which hasn't strayed from its Republican roots since 1964 ? even with big-name Republicans such as Rep. Jason Chaffetz and Gov. Gary Herbert withdrawing their support for Trump in recent days. 
""I still think it's unlikely that he takes the state of Utah,"" Jason Perry, director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah. But for Clinton and Trump, he said, ""I think it's going to be closer than anyone could have expected."" And losing the state's six Electoral Votes could seriously complicate Trump's ability to win the 270 needed to win the White House.

McMullin, who was born in Provo, Utah, graduated from BYU and then went to get a business degree from the University of Pennsylvania before serving as a Mormon missionary in Brazil. As a CIA operative after Sept. 11, 2001, he spearheaded counterterrorism and intelligence operations overseas for a decade. 
His connection to the Mormon church has given him a particularly strong foothold among Utah's broad Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints community in a way his fellow third-party competitor hasn't been able to attain. 
""Many Utahns feel they know exactly what they're going to get from McMullin as a candidate,"" Perry said. ""Gary Johnson has just not played very well in the state of Utah."" 
Whether he wins or not, McMullin says he fears for the future of the GOP. 
""I seriously doubt the Republican party is viable as a political vehicle going forward. I think it will shrink in size, I think it might become a white nationalist party if Donald Trump supporters remain active after the election,"" he said.

By LAURA SUCHESKI 
California incumbents have started to pony up cash to protect their seats from bipartisan redistricting, hoping to restore the old system that favors safe seats and partisan gerrymandering. 
This week, the ballot measure to do away with the Citizens Redistricting Commission was approved by the California Secretary of State?s Office and assigned a number.&#160; Proposition 27, the Financial Accountability in Redistricting Act, will face voters on the General Election ballot in November. 
If enacted, the initiative would invalidate Proposition 11 and put the power of redistricting back in the hands of elected state representatives, who have been known to gerrymander their seats into security. &#160;&#160;Proposition 11, enacted by a slim majority in 2008, established a redistricting commission that all but ensures a politically balanced commission of citizen volunteers insulated from partisan politics. 
To those interested in good government, Prop. 27 represents a step backwards.&#160; ?It restores the same formula for gerrymandering that existed before Proposition 11,? said Doug Johnson, a fellow at the Rose Institute of State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College. 
A voter perusing the submitted paperwork for the proposition might be sympathetic to its findings, however. &#160;?Our political leadership has failed us,? proclaims the proposed initiative. 
Yet if passed, the law would give the power of redistricting back to the same politicians they accuse of making a mess of state government, with no indication of how the situation would suddenly rectify itself. 
?Sacramento has become a full time game of Musical Chairs,? write proponents. ?Where incumbent term-limited politicians serve out their maximum term in one office then run for another office where they are a shoo in.&#160; This must stop!?

By age 10, that mistrust of police had been cemented after his father was discovered dead in a river ? and a local sheriff hastily classified it as an accidental drowning, not a murder, Putney, now 47, has acknowledged publicly several times. 
Putney himself became a police officer 26 years ago, rising through the ranks until his promotion to Charlotte police chief 15 months ago. 
Those who know him say he chose to enter the force so he could make a difference from within, smooth out racial tensions he had felt as a black man, and make the community more comfortable around officers than he had ever been. 
Now, a week after a black man was shot dead by a Charlotte police officer, Putney is being accused of putting his officers' needs before those of Keith Lamont Scott's family. Activists are demanding his resignation, arguing Scott's death was the latest in a string of racial profiling by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. 
Putney did not immediately return a phone call from NBC News. A former colleague described him as shy and reserved, a ""thoughtful person dedicated to his work"" who helped bring implicit bias training to his department ? an initiative aimed at preventing unconscious bias from affecting law enforcement decisions. 
""I know that this troubles him deeply because of all the work he's done,"" former Charlotte-Mecklensburg Police Department Chief Darrel Stephens told NBC News. Stephens has known Putney since 1999 and is now the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a national organization of police chiefs. 
Related: Footage Shows Fatal Encounter Between Police, Keith Lamont Scott 
But on Monday, activists argued that both Putney and Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts had failed to protect citizens, particularly minorities and the working class. 
?This moment represents a tipping point for a community that has had its trust repeatedly broken by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department,"" said Bree Newsome, a Charlotte advocate who made headlines last year when she scaled a flag pole at the South Carolina statehouse and removed the Confederate flag. 
She and several other activists and citizens have called on Putney and Roberts to resign. 
Not everyone agrees, however. Sean ""Lucky"" Corbett, a former felon who pulled his life together to start Da Lucky Spot Barbershop in Charlotte six years ago, said Putney is a friendly face around town who puts the needs of the community first.

The photos were the first seen since August. 
The 21 photos were in an article titled ?Castro is amazing? by Perdomo about his encounter with the renowned communist figure to discuss a celebration of the leader?s 70-year-anniversary of his entry into the University of Havana. 
In the images, Castro and Perdomo are seen enthusiastically looking through photos, the television, CDs, a plate which reads ?Havana University,? and a newspaper reporting the release of the three Cuban intelligence agents by the United States as part of the Dec. 17 declaration to re-establish U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations. 
The Havana student reports that Castrois keeping up with current events and exercising, and he and Perdomo spoke of diverse subjects such as astronomy, international politics, agriculture, and animals which Nambia had donated to The National Zoo of Cuba. 
Castro and Perdomo&#160;also spoke about the production of natural food, Cuba?s contribution in fighting Ebola, and education at the university. Throughout the article Castro is shown to be optimistic and curious. 
?Castro was interested in the Aula Magna, the Frank Fernandez concert, Jose Marti, and entrance exams during his anniversary,? writes Perdomo. ?I explained that students from different nationalities share the student building to learn Spanish in Cuba: Chinese, North Americans, and Vietnamese. Then Castro said, ?You?re kidding! There are Asians too?'? 
These had been the first images of the retired leader since August when photos were taken of him and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. In 2006, becoming very ill, he handed over political power to his brother Raul but continued to be an important figure in Cuban politics. 
Nevertheless, Castro?s appearances in public have become more and more uncommon since he left office He had not issued a statement since the Dec. 17 declaration where he had agreed to negotiations and there had been strong speculation about the aging leader?s health.

The 2013 headline is basically that the United States falls right in the middle of the pack, as it has for several decades. The US Department of Education and its allies used those&#160; rankings&#160;to argue that US schools are ?stagnating? and to advance specific reforms it says will fix them. However, average scores may obscure and confuse more than they inform. Indeed, scores from individual states that have their own PISA rankings offer more policy-relevant insight than overall US rankings. This makes sense ? US education looks more like a diverse patchwork than a unified system. Public investments in schools, and in students and their families, vary greatly across states, as do other policies that may boost or depress scores. Luckily, this year, three states received individual PISA rankings ? as if they were independent countries. This can help us connect the dots between those disparities and scores. 
Massachusetts is the good news story. If it were its own country, it would rank&#160; sixth in reading&#160;of 65 countries and economies included, behind only Singapore, Japan, Korea and the Chinese regions of Shanghai and Hong Kong. Its students rank just above Finland and Canada, some of the world?s best readers. Though its math scores are slightly lower, Massachusetts keeps company with Belgium and Germany and is only slightly behind Finland and Canada, ranking 16 of 65. In science, Massachusetts ranks 11th, ahead of Canada and Germany. Connecticut, the second of three states with its own scores, falls just below Massachusetts, ranking 9th in reading, 18th in math and 17th in science. 
 
On the other hand, Florida?s students rank below the US average in all three categories. They are 27th in reading, ahead of Austria, but behind the Czech Republic. In science, Florida is 38th, behind Spain, Portugal and Italy, and just ahead of Slovenia. Florida?s math scores are the most troubling. If it were a country, it would rank 41st of 65, behind Croatia and ten points lower than Hungary. 
How might these more nuanced findings inform policy? The Department of Education advocates raising academic standards, using student test scores to evaluate teachers, and implementing school ?turnaround? policies that include firing staff, closing schools and converting them to charters. More recently, it has made quality early childhood education a high priority. If Massachusetts is a good indicator of what works, high standards help. However, attaining the benefits of high standards is contingent on first laying a&#160; foundation of comprehensive student, family and school supports. The same is true of turning around schools ? years of investment in access to quality pre-kindergarten programs, physical and mental health care and extra support for teachers serving in struggling schools appear to be key ingredients in the state?s recipe for success.

Another factor distinguishing these states is the average income of their residents. In 2011, Connecticut ranked 4th of the 50 states, with a&#160; median household income of $65,753, and Massachusetts was next, at $62,859. Florida, in contrast, ranked 37th, at just $44,299. While high income itself does not drive scores, it reflects parents? education and employment and a range of resulting public and private choices that interact with one another to&#160; strongly influence educational achievement. Moreover, these large resource disparities are compounded by states? decisions regarding how they are used. Equitable school funding, which the PISA study finds to boost test scores, also varies greatly across states. The&#160; Education Law Center&#160;&#160;puts Connecticut and Massachusetts slightly above average on equity, while Florida is one of only three states to receive poor grades on all four main indicators, making it among the very least equitable. 
These findings shine a spotlight on the opportunity gaps driving achievement gaps across states (and within them). They thus make a strong case for a ?Broader, Bolder Approach to Education? (a campaign of the Economic Policy Institute with which we are both affiliated); high-quality early childhood education, rigorous, enriching instruction for all students and comprehensive supports to help alleviate poverty-related impediments to learning. Equitable school funding can further narrow gaps. Education policies should not revolve around raising scores on PISA ? or any test. But taking a page from the Massachusetts policy book ? the broadest and boldest of any state ? would improve the life prospects of disadvantaged students. 
And if PISA scores go up too, that is certainly not a bad thing."

It appears that one has now been found that could do the job. 
Because of the overuse and improper use of antibiotics, a super-strain of bacteria has been developed. These are now called superbugs and they cannot be killed by most existing antibiotics. 
The superbugs can become so powerful that they kill a lot of people every year and there is no way to stop the infections. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that there are two million Americans who become infected annually and 23,000 die from them. 
More and more superbugs are being found. There are so many already, that some researchers are warning that the world is going into a ?post-biotic? era. This is when patients could die from something that was rather easily treatable just a few years ago, or it could mean that patients may die from simple medical surgeries from infection. 
It has been known for many years that the soil contains many forms of bacteria. Scientists have tried for years to find more bacteria that could be used as an antibiotic from a pile of soil. Most of it, however, in fact, 99 percent of those bacteria cannot be grown in a lab. 
A new method has recently been found which should provide opportunities to find new antibiotics. The bacteria are basically tricked into acting like it is still in the soil. This method has enabled researchers to begin testing on tens of thousands of bacteria that may become the next antibiotic. 
One new form that has been discovered in soil is called a teixobactin. While still very new, the good news is that researchers have not yet found any bacteria that are resistant to it. Even various forms of Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not resistant. It kills them all. 
The teixobactin antibiotic goes to work by attacking the materials that make up the cell wall. This method of attack creates a situation where the bacteria will find it very difficult to build up some kind of resistance. 
Tests performed on mice so far have yielded positive results. Besides killing the undesirable bacteria, it also had no side effects. The threat of superbugs continues to grow. The number of deaths in the U.S. and in Europe is about 50,000 per year. By 2050, projections say that there could be as many as 10 million annually. 
While teixobactin looks very promising, it will not be appearing on the market any time soon. Testing on humans is not projected to start for another two years. Then, if everything goes well, it would take about another five to six years before it reaches the market.

By Chris Reed 
On Monday, an Assembly committee took up three bills intended to ban or limit fracking in California. All three passed. Incredibly and pathetically, the first coverage of this development ? by the Ventura County Star?s Timm Herdt ? did not note that the Obama administration considers fracking just another heavy industry, not the devil incarnate. 
But this is the norm. And this is why that starting last Saturday, every morning I?ve been blogging about the nations around the world that are embracing hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, on economic competitiveness grounds. So far I?ve covered Germany, China and Russia. Today I?m writing about the nation that was was supplanted last year by the U.S. as the world leader in oil production because of fracking. My point: The fracking/brown energy revolution is coming, regardless of what greens in Santa Monica, Ventura County and Marin County think, and that California can either join in the party or get left behind. 
 
What does the world look like from Riyadh, as opposed to Sacramento? Like this: 
?After much resistance and a mix of disdain and resentfulness, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries suddenly decided to embrace fracking ? That means, of course, that it?s really Saudi Arabia, OPEC?s largest member and frequent dissenter among the organization?s ranks, that has done the embracing. Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters in Hong Kong the kingdom intends to remain an energy powerhouse, partly by adopting new technology. 
?Naimi estimated Saudi Arabia has roughly 600 trillion cubic feet of unconventional shale gas. ?The potential is very huge and we plan to exploit it,? he told The Wall Street Journal on Monday. 
?The Energy Department?s Energy Information Administration says Saudi Arabia?s proven natural-gas reserves are 288 trillion cubic feet as of the end of 2012. That?s the fifth largest behind Russia, Iran, Qatar and the U.S., the EIA said.?

If one reads the professional journals on energy exploration, as opposed to newspapers and magazines with an incredibly superficial familiarity with the issue, you quickly notice the matter-of-fact acceptance of the idea that the world is way different than it was a decade ago, and it?s because of unconventional strategies pioneered by U.S. firms.

LAT?s&#160;Ralph Vartabedian did a good job painting a downbeat picture of the bullet train?s prospects after negative legal and regulatory rulings. 
But he didn?t ask the question that blows a gaping hole in the side of the Good Ship Baloney that blustery Dan is piloting to depict a project still on track and facing minor challenges. 
So here goes: This is the email I have sent to him. 
Dec. 14, 2013 
Dear Dan: 
In Saturday?s Los Angeles Times, reporter Ralph Vartabedian wrote about Sacramento Superior Court Judge Michael Kenny?s recent finding that the California High-Speed Rail Authority could not legally spend its state bond funds on construction of the bullet-train?s initial link because it didn?t have a legal business plan or sufficient environmental reviews. Vartabedian also wrote about a federal agency?s refusal to expedite a permit sought by the rail authority. I would like to ask you about this part of the story: 
?Dan Richard, chairman of the California High-Speed Rail Authority, countered that the recent setbacks to the bullet train ? connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco with 220 mph trains ? represent normal challenges encountered by giant, visionary public works projects. 
?In a recent debate on public radio, he characterized the legal problems as largely procedural and suggested that ?crossing the Ts and dotting the I?s? would resolve the issues. 
?Claims of a ?major setback are wildly overstated,? he said.? 
My question is this: If the obstacles presented by Kenny?s ruling are ?largely procedural,? then why was the rail authority unable to address and resolve them after Kenny?s initial Aug. 16 ruling that the project didn?t have adequate financing or complete environmental reviews for the $31 billion, 300-mile initial operating segment? From Aug. 16 to Kenny?s release of his final ruling on Nov. 25, the rail authority had 101 days to take care of the judge?s objections. It never did. 
Now you describe these objections as ?largely procedural.? 
I look forward to your explanation as to why these obstacles are all but trivial, yet the rail authority was unable to take care of them over the 14 weeks and three days from Kenny?s initial ruling to his final ruling. 
Sincerely, 
Chris Reed

An additional 86 million have borderline diabetes or ?prediabetes? as it is known in medical circles. Nearly 40 percent of Americans have some form of insulin resistance and many of those people will eventually develop outright diabetes. A new study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings offers a suggestion as to why those numbers are so astronomical. 
High-fructose corn syrup, the perennial boogyman of healthy living, is now joined by sucrose and fructose as the most likely factors in the development of diabetes and other metabolic disorders. These ?added sugars? can be found in over 75 percent of the packaged food and drinks in America, according to the report. 
The study was conducted by Saint Luke?s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri. The researchers reviewed the findings of several clinical studies and observational trials and concluded that it was the excessive consumption of added sugars that disturbed the metabolism and caused insulin resistance. The study also found fructose and sucrose had negative effects on cholesterol and blood pressure. 
Meanwhile, natural sugars such as glucose or starch caused no adverse effects. Nor did the low concentrations of fructose naturally found in fruits and vegetables. 
Currently, there are no limitations to the amount of added sugars food or beverages contain. Nutrition labels often do not disclose what type of sugars are in the food. Though certainly an underestimate, the authors believe the typical American consumes at least 83 grams of fructose a day. Last month, in a similar study, Medical News Today reported that female mice given the same proportion of added sugar as the average American consumes daily had significantly reduced lifespans. 
?There is no biological need for any added sugars in the diet, particularly those containing fructose,? said the study?s lead author James DiNicolantonio. ?At an individual level, limiting consumption of foods and beverages that contain added sugars, particularly added fructose, may be one of the most effective strategies for ensuring one?s robust future health.?

Twitter	"ISTANBUL, Turkey ? Turkey has blocked Twitter hours after the prime minister vowed he?d ?eradicate? the popular social media site. 
A controversial new internet law passed last month allows the country?s telecommunications authority to order content removed within hours without a court order. 
On Thursday night, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed Twitter wasn?t complying with the new law, and told a rally of thousands that he?d bring the site down. 
The press advisory of the Prime Ministry later in the night clarified Erdogan's statement, arguing that Twitter officials currently ""ignore"" some court rulings in Turkey, which order the social media platform to ""remove some links"" as per the complaints filed by Turkish citizens. 
""[In Erdogan's speech] it is stated that as long as Twitter fails to change its attitude of ignoring court rulings and not doing what is necessary according to the law, technically, there might be no remedy but to block access in order to relieve our citizens,"" the statement said. 
Reaction to the move ? which came around midnight Friday local time ? was swift. Major newspapers posted instructions offering simple technical workarounds to access the site. 
?This is certainly a step backwards in terms of openness, transparency and the democratization process of Turkey,? said Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul. ?Restrictions on political speech and discourse of this scale is unacceptable in any country including in Turkey.? 
Twitter representatives confirmed reports that the site had been disrupted. 
?We're looking into this now,? said Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler. The company?s official account offered Turkish cell phone subscribers ways to send tweets via text message. 
The cause of the ban is most certainly political as Turkey prepares for March 30 local elections, seen as a key test of power for the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party, now in its 11th year of rule. 
Anonymous users have been posting links to YouTube of audio recordings purporting to be wiretaps that expose rampant corruption within Erdogan's inner circle. 
This follows a corruption scandal that erupted Dec. 17 that implicated three cabinet ministers as well as businessmen with close ties to the prime minister?s closest associates. 
""Certainly this is politically motivated just prior to the local elections"" 
The government has responded to the accusations with mass purges of the police and judiciary as well as by ordering evidence destroyed. Erdogan has said the accusations are part of a plot hatched by a former ideological ally, Fethullah Gulen ? a Pennsylvania-based Islamic cleric ? whom he accuses of conspiring to bring down his government. 
?It was just a matter of moment for Prime Minister Erdogan and his men to decide to ban Twitter,? said Erkan Saka, an outspoken blogger and communications lecturer at Bilgi University in Istanbul. ?Twitter remains the main channel for freedom of expression and dissemination of corruption file leaks.? 
Cyber law experts say the ban on Twitter is reminiscent of the YouTube ban that lasted for 18 months from 2008-2010. 
?Certainly this is politically motivated just prior to the local elections,? Akdeniz said. ?I suspect the decisions were issued prior to the PM's speech but they were only executed subsequent to his speech.? 
Some of the alleged leaked wiretaps appeared to record Erdogan himself instructing media companies to censor coverage of last spring?s Gezi Park protests. Such censorship ? during the protests CNN T?rk famously showed a documentary on penguins in Antarctica in place of the news ? is another reason why Twitter has been an important tool for Turkish citizens to share information, unrestricted, in real time. Several media companies during Erdogan?s tenure as prime minister have been fined or taken over by companies close to the government.

The Golden State has returned to take its&#160;former position&#160;among&#160;the world?s largest economies. World Bank calculations show&#160;California ? if it were considered a country ? placing eighth&#160;in size worldwide. That?s still well below fifth&#160;place, where the&#160;state had ranked&#160;going into&#160;the early 2000s&#160;? but&#160;a significant increase from its spot two years ago at the bottom of the global top 10. 
The news caps what has been over six years of roller coaster economic and budgetary uncertainty, for Californian&#160;voters and politicians alike. But for most politicians and policy experts, the state?s health is hardly a settled matter. 
The&#160;situation is nowhere near as dire as it was in 2009, when the nation?s big banks rejected the IOUs issued to cover California?s multibillion-dollar state budget deficit. Arnold Schwarzenegger still was presiding over the budget disaster. 
Under Gov. Jerry Brown, who took office in 2011, the state?s credit rating has been stabilized,&#160;and hiked taxes and revenues have been used to pull the&#160;budget back from the fiscal abyss. On the other hand, stubborn problems remain ? from drought and&#160;out-migration to a still-daunting debt&#160;and a hunger to spend in Sacramento. 
In other words, California?s economic situation has been salvaged enough to allow a fresh look at&#160;its structural challenges. While Democrats are more inclined to view public transportation and carbon emissions as typical, those further to the right have pointed&#160;to policymaking itself as an even more fundamental difficulty. 
Gov. Brown?s hope has been to chart&#160;what his team has presented as a middle course. But the $68 billion high-speed rail project at the centerpiece of Brown?s agenda has shown the limitations of&#160;his approach. While annoying Democrats by re-routing cap-and-trade funds away from emissions reduction, Brown has attracted ridicule from Republicans. 
Republican&#160;antagonism&#160;goes beyond traditional tax-and-spend critiques. Democratic policymaking itself, Republicans are well positioned to argue, can be blamed&#160;for the&#160;logistical, technical, environmental, legal, financial and regulatory impediments to the train?s progress. California?s barely-there high-speed rail has already revealed how competing priorities, unintended consequences and planning overreach typify the kinds of large projects large governments undertake. 
There?s even more at stake, however. Brown?s administration, and his legacy, are tied to the bullet train for more than superficially political reasons. The train is a central part of California Democrats? vision of economic growth and progress. Sympathetic analysts around the country, including the public-transit-heavy East Coast corridor, have insisted that California?s economic future depends on the train and similar projects. 
The more difficult claim to uphold, however, is that high-speed rail can only be trusted to&#160;policy planners and funded with public tax dollars. While California?s&#160;effort has run into immediate and grave trouble, its advocates have laughed off proposals like Elon Musk?s private-sector ?hyperloop? plan for ultrafast mass transit. Ultimately, the argument for Brown?s favored train hasn?t turned on the wisdom of government-planned economic growth ? but on impatience with the current state of Californian productivity. 
Republicans, however, have&#160;expressed their own impatience on this subject. Much of California?s economic health has been driven by technology, tourism and trade, according to Steve Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. Yet California government has pursued an uneven-at-best relationship with Silicon Valley. As Sacramento?s planned crackdown on Uber has underscored, Democratic legislators are often&#160;cozy&#160;with California?s tech constituency on social and cultural issues, but hostile when it comes to the disruptive power of innovators to create wealth and dictate the pace of economic growth. 
Reliance on tourism, meanwhile, has proven to be a double-edged sword even for large&#160;economies like Italy?s.&#160;Though tourism brings cash in, it also makes locals and residents dependent upon outsiders for productivity. In California, meanwhile, millionaires and others&#160;have begun steadily flowing out of state ? notably, to more enterprise-friendly states like Texas. 
Finally, in the area of trade,&#160;a Southern California Teamster strike threatens to undo the gains California has made this year, with consequences spreading throughout the rest of the country. Democrats&#160;have long sided with unions in labor disputes; doing so now, however, would require them to dial back their enthusiasm for their state?s economic ranking. 
Together, these developments have sharpened the debate over California?s economic future. Even if the state climbs higher in the global rankings, the drama surrounding Sacramento?s approach to productivity shows that size isn?t everything."	"b'<article id=""0551547"" published-at=""2018-07-20"" title=""CA economic ranking renews debate""><p>For those who put a lot of stock in statistics, it?s a good month for California. The Golden State has returned to take its&amp;#160;former position&amp;#160;among&amp;#160;the world?s largest economies. World Bank calculations <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/2014/07/08/6538711/california-has-worlds-8th-largest.html"" type=""external"">show</a>&amp;#160;California ? if it were considered a country ? placing eighth&amp;#160;in size worldwide. That?s still well below fifth&amp;#160;place, where the&amp;#160;state had ranked&amp;#160;going into&amp;#160;the early 2000s&amp;#160;? but&amp;#160;a significant increase from its spot two years ago at the bottom of the global top 10.</p> \n<p>The news caps what has been over six years of roller coaster economic and budgetary uncertainty, for Californian&amp;#160;voters and politicians alike. But for most politicians and policy experts, the state?s health is hardly a settled matter.</p> \n<p>The&amp;#160;situation is nowhere near as dire as it was in 2009, when the nation?s big banks <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB124692354575702881"" type=""external"">rejected</a> the IOUs issued to cover California?s multibillion-dollar state budget deficit. Arnold Schwarzenegger still was presiding over the budget disaster.</p> \n<p>Under Gov. Jerry Brown, who took office in 2011, the state?s credit rating has been stabilized,&amp;#160;and hiked taxes and revenues have been used to pull the&amp;#160;budget back from the fiscal abyss. On the other hand, stubborn problems <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/01/23/Jerry-Brown-s-California-A-State-in-Denial"" type=""external"">remain</a> ? from drought and&amp;#160;out-migration to a still-daunting debt&amp;#160;and a hunger to spend in Sacramento.</p> \n<p>In other words, California?s economic situation has been salvaged enough to allow a fresh look at&amp;#160;its structural challenges. While Democrats are more inclined to view public transportation and carbon emissions as typical, those further to the right have pointed&amp;#160;to policymaking itself as an even more fundamental difficulty.</p> \n<p>Gov. Brown?s hope has been to chart&amp;#160;what his team has presented as a middle course. But the $68 billion high-speed rail project at the centerpiece of Brown?s agenda has shown the limitations of&amp;#160;his approach. While <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/2014/06/12/6480411/budget-deal-spends-cap-and-trade.html"" type=""external"">annoying</a> Democrats by re-routing cap-and-trade funds away from emissions reduction, Brown has attracted ridicule from Republicans.</p> \n<p>Republican&amp;#160;antagonism&amp;#160;goes beyond traditional tax-and-spend critiques. Democratic policymaking itself, Republicans are well positioned to argue, can be blamed&amp;#160;for the&amp;#160;logistical, technical, environmental, legal, financial and regulatory impediments to the train?s progress. California?s barely-there high-speed rail has already revealed how competing priorities, unintended consequences and planning overreach typify the kinds of large projects large governments undertake.</p> \n<p>There?s even more at stake, however. Brown?s administration, and his legacy, are tied to the bullet train for more than superficially political reasons. The train is a central part of California Democrats? vision of economic growth and progress. Sympathetic analysts around the country, including the public-transit-heavy East Coast corridor, have <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/the-california-high-speed-rail-debate-kicking-things-off/374135/"" type=""external"">insisted</a> that California?s economic future depends on the train and similar projects.</p> \n<p>The more difficult claim to uphold, however, is that high-speed rail can only be trusted to&amp;#160;policy planners and funded with public tax dollars. While California?s&amp;#160;effort has run into immediate and grave trouble, its advocates have laughed off proposals like Elon Musk?s private-sector <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-12/revealed-elon-musk-explains-the-hyperloop"" type=""external"">?hyperloop?</a> plan for ultrafast mass transit. Ultimately, the argument for Brown?s favored train hasn?t turned on the wisdom of government-planned economic growth ? but on impatience with the current state of Californian productivity.</p> \n<p>Republicans, however, have&amp;#160;expressed their own impatience on this subject. Much of California?s economic health has been driven by technology, tourism and trade, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/07/08/californias-economy-is-large-enough-it-could-be-admitted-into-g-8/"" type=""external"">according to</a> Steve Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. Yet California government has pursued an uneven-at-best relationship with Silicon Valley.

Hays County, Texas, authorities Wednesday released about 12 hours of calls that poured into 911 as the Blanco River flooded the town of Wimberley on Memorial Day ? rising 28 feet in an hour and a half. 
Several calls were from the home where Laura and Jonathan McComb of Corpus Christi, their family and friends were vacationing when the floodwaters flashed in. 
""The water is up to the second story into the house,"" Laura McComb says in the first call from the address, at 11:11 p.m. on May 23 (12:11 a.m. ET May 24). ""It's coming up to the second floor. I mean, it's so high up. And we have no exit out."" 
The 911 operator tells McComb that help is on the way and to try to get everyone out ? but to avoid getting trapped in the attic upstairs. 
At 11:26, a man calls from the same address to report: ""We're running out of breathing room."" 
At 11:29, a woman calls again from the home. The call lasts only about a minute before it breaks up: 
Caller: ""Our house is down! We're floating! ... We're floating and we've got three [unintelligible] in the house!"" (Later, it was learned that three children were in the house.) 
Dispatcher: ""OK, we do have a call for Deer Crossing, and we're going to get out there as soon as we can. Are you on the roof of your house or where are you located?"" 
Silence. 
Dispatcher: ""Hello? Are you all inside your residence still?"" 
Three minutes later, a call from a different address comes in. It's a man, and he tells dispatchers: ""A house just went by through the river, and there was someone in it with a bright light. ... They've already hit the bridge, I'm sure."" 
Jonathan McComb survived and was found miles from where the home stood. He suffered a collapsed lung, a broken sternum and broken ribs. 
Six of the vacationers have been found dead, including Randy Charba, 42, whose body wasn't found until Saturday, not far from the body of Laura McComb. Two children, Leighton McComb, 4, and Will Charba, 6, are still missing 2? weeks later. 
In all, 23 people are confirmed to have been killed in the floods across the state."

Lest you think I am daft, Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates believe something similar as well.&#160; In fact, renowned physicist Hawking just made a statement while addressing a group at Oxford University projecting the human race will need to escape the planet within the next 1,000 years for the species to continue to survive. 
OK, not all of the reasons he cited were due to the rise in Artificial Intelligence (AI), but he had concerns along that road, telling the BBC back in 2014 that full development of AI could spell the end of the human race. 
Hawking has also warned the once AI is fully developed, it will begin to re-design itself at a much faster rate than human intelligence could, and we simply won?t be able to keep up with an ever-evolving intelligence superior to our own. 
I hear the argument that computers can only output the information they have been given by human interfacing, but once AI is applied, and computers begin to think for themselves, who knows?&#160; Even if they are limited to the information provided to them, the can process it much faster that the human mind. 
Let?s say, a new technology begins as an idea in someone?s mind.&#160; They may spend months and years of trial and error to work out all the details to make the new technology cost-effective and useful to society.&#160; A computer?s processing speed and use of data models could reduce that time to weeks or even days. 
But that?s a good thing, right?&#160; Maybe now, but what if the thinking machine moves immediately on to the next technology, one that human minds have not yet began to imagine?&#160; And what if the AI begins to realize it can do this job more efficiently without the anchor of human interface dragging behind?&#160; Will the machine block humans from interfacing, and proceed on its own?&#160; Will we be able to put the genie back in the bottle if necessary? 
And what about economic concerns?&#160; A great example is a textile mill located in my home town.&#160; Back in the 1970s, the facility employed over 700 men and women in the single location.&#160; Technology and innovation over the next 25 years reduced the number of employees to less than 50, while increasing the production output for the facility. 
Great for the company, but for the 650 workers that lost their jobs and their source of income, it wasn?t all that great.&#160; And, mind you, computer technology was in its infancy during that time, at least compared to today. 
As the population across the globe continues to increase, and automation continues to require fewer and fewer actual humans, where are these people going to find employment and how are they going to support their families?&#160; Sure, someone has to maintain the thinking machines.&#160; But what if the machines figure out how to maintain themselves through automation and AI? 
The gap between the haves and the have-nots will more than likely continue to grow, as those who control the thinking machines will control the world. 
At least until the thinking machines decide the humans are more like pests than partners. 
I love technology.&#160; I find it fascinating that I have all this information available to me in an instant on my smartphone, and I am thrilled I have 250 channels on my tv, even if I still can?t find anything to watch.&#160; I am thankful for the technology that afforded me the chance to live longer after finding three of my arteries were blocked. 
But we need to be careful with the way this new intelligence is being applied.&#160; Passing a point of no return could mean the end of human life on Earth.

She soon shrugs off the memory of the attack, and rejoins other children in the playground deep underground at the Fus'ha Children's Center. 
Set up by a group of teachers and parents last year, the center has been a lifeline for kids like Heba who are locked away at home because of fears of airstrikes that have ravaged Syrian cities since the 2011 uprising against President Bashar Assad. Children can attend six days a week for up to four hours a day. 
Estimates for the number of children killed in the five-year Syria conflict vary, although a 2014 United Nations-commissioned report put the figure at more than 8,800. 
Outside on Aleppo's streets, piles of gray debris stand at the foot of skeletal buildings pulverized by years of shelling. Small broken bodies of children are often quarried from the rubble.

But inside a nondescript building and down a steep flight of stairs, a riot of color and noise greets kids who play and sing in four brightly painted rooms. 
""It's a friendly place for kids, a place where children can be safe. It is underground,"" Yaman Salame, 26, who works at the center, said before going on to officiate a sack race. 
Zakaria Kurdi echoes a sentiment felt by many of the children ? she feels safe here. 
""In the street or the house, we're really scared. Here, nothing will happen,"" the 8-year-old said. 
Stray bombs and bullets aren't the only worry. A 2016 U.N. report noted the ""massive"" recruitment of children by ISIS, as well as the execution, imprisonment and torture of children by various sides in the conflict. 
Many of the 250 children who visit the center no longer go to school, which along with hospitals have not been spared from Syrian government and Russian airstrikes. This is a tiny fraction of the some 100,000 kids who are believed to be living in the city being besieged by forces supporting Assad. 
The children's preference for playing in small rooms underground with no natural light, rather than in the bright sunshine outside, underlines the trauma of growing up in a war zone. 
""As a result of losing a father, a mother or siblings, a child would be in a state of psychiatric disorder, generally speaking. We have to keep an eye on the activities, and the psychological counselor will work with the child,"" said Majida, 28, one of the center's counselors. 
Some of the children show signs of raised aggression and anxiety or reluctance to take part in activities, disorders the organization helps counter through play. 
""It's really nice. First, the children started to work together, to like each other, to take care of each other. Even the simple things, like they share their food, they learn a lot of nice things here,"" said Marwa, the mother of one of the children. 
The center hopes to expand in other neighborhoods, but its future is far from assured, with electricity and fuel shortages sometimes forcing it to close. Aleppo is under a weeks-long siege by government forces, and shortages have triggered international alarm. 
Charity Save the Children is warning of a ""humanitarian catastrophe."" 
Despite the children's aversion to the outdoors, birds and flowers seem to be among the most popular themes as they draw pictures in a room set aside for arts and crafts. 
In another room, a teacher teaches the importance of unity, inviting a boy to try to break a bunch of pencils after easily snapping a single pencil in two. 
When the activities end, the door at the top of the stairs opens into blinding sunlight. 
The children, some chatting, some running, some holding hands, emerge into the world outside.

In Georgia, which the GOP has won since 1996, Trump is ahead by three points among likely voters, 46 percent to 43 percent. (Among registered voters, the candidates are tied at 44 percent each.) 
In Nevada, which Barack Obama carried in 2008 and 2012, Clinton is up by one point, 45 percent to 44 percent (but she?s ahead by five points among registered voters, 46 percent to 41 percent). 
And in New Hampshire, which Obama also won in the last two presidential elections, Clinton leads Trump by one point, 42 percent to 41 percent (and they?re tied at 40 percent each among registered voters). 
All of these results are within each poll?s margin of error. The surveys were conducted Sept. 6-8. 
?As we enter the final lap of this very unconventional election, it would not be surprising if the electoral map in the end has new contours,? says Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ?Any of these four states could awaken a fault line in what is looking more and more like a shake-up election with more states being up for grabs.? 
The race in these states remains equally close when the ballot is expanded to three and four candidates, including Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and the Green Party?s Jill Stein. 
In Arizona, Trump gets 40 percent, Clinton gets 38 percent, Johnson gets 12 percent and Stein gets 3 percent. 
In Georgia, it?s Trump at 44 percent, Clinton at 42 percent and Johnson at 10 percent. (Stein isn?t on the ballot in Georgia.) 
In Nevada, it?s Trump at 42 percent, Clinton at 41 percent, Johnson at 8 percent and Stein at 3 percent. 
And in New Hampshire, it?s Clinton at 39 percent, Trump at 37 percent, Johnson at 15 percent and Stein at 3 percent. 
GOP Ahead in All Four Senate Contests 
All four states also feature contested Senate races, and Republicans lead in all of them, although Nevada is well within the poll?s margin of error. 
In Arizona, incumbent Republican Sen. John McCain leads Democratic challenger Ann Kirkpatrick by 19 points among likely voters, 57 percent to 38 percent. (The result is the same among all registered voters.) 
In Georgia, incumbent GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson leads Democrat Jim Barksdale by 15 points, 53 percent to 38 percent. 
In Nevada, which is one of the key Senate races this cycle, Republican Joe Heck gets 47 percent among likely voters, while Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto gets 45 percent. (Among registered voters, it?s Cortez Masto 46 percent, Heck 45 percent.) 
And in New Hampshire, which could end up deciding control of the Senate, incumbent GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte leads Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan by eight points among likely voters, 52 percent to 44 percent. (And among registered voters, Ayotte?s lead is seven points, 51 percent to 44 percent.) 
The NBC/WSJ/Marist polls were conducted Sept. 6-8. In Arizona, the poll interviewed 946 registered voters (which has a margin of error of plus-minus 3.2 percentage points) and 649 likely voters (plus-minus 3.8 percentage points) by landline and cell phone. 
In Georgia, the surveyinterviewed 913 registered voters (plus-minus 3.2 percentage points) and 625 likely voters (plus-minus 3.9 percentage points). 
In Nevada, it interviewed 915 registered voters (plus-minus 3.2 percentage points) and 627 likely voters (plus-minus 3.9 percentage points). 
And in New Hampshire, it interviewed 987 registered voters (plus-minus 3.1 percentage points) and 737 likely voters (plus-minus 3.6 percentage points)."

Dear Dr. Don,

I'm wondering about diversification using investment firms. I opened my first Roth individual retirement account with the same company where I have my 401(k) and stock investments. Is it a mistake to put all of my money in one place?

Dear Corny, 
A common adage, which also applies to investing, is ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket."" The opposite idea is attributable to industrialist Andrew Carnegie, ""Put all your eggs in one basket and then watch the basket."" The question then becomes, ""Which approach is right for you?"" 
The attraction to having your investment accounts held at only one firm is convenience and focus. When your investments are managed by a single firm, it's easier for the financial professional there to help you with asset allocation decisions and portfolio rebalancing. 
Diversifying your investment accounts across firms will not protect you against investment losses. What you would be protecting yourself against is theft of your assets by a broker. Other potential worries include if the brokerage firm fails if your total investments are worth more than Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits. 
The specific company where you keep your investments, like many brokerage firms, offers insurance coverage over and above the SIPC coverage for its customer. The additional coverage kicks in when those limits are exhausted for the customer. 
Are you really worried about the theft of your investment securities, or about the future of your company? You probably don't need to be. It is also unlikely that another firm provides much different investing options. 
Stay focused on how you are investing. You don't need to worry so much about moving your money around.

Gross domestic product grew by 0.8% in the second quarter from the first quarter and 1.8% from a year earlier, data showed Wednesday. 
Continue Reading Below 
That was close to economists' forecasts of 0.9% growth over the quarter and 1.9% growth over the year. And it was a strong result compared with first-quarter growth, which was left unchanged at 0.3% on-quarter. 
Australia has now completed 26 years of growth since the last recession in the early 1990s. 
The upbeat data reflect rising business confidence in Australia, which has played out in much stronger employment growth and rising non-mining investment. 
Treasurer Scott Morrison said the economic momentum improved the prospect of a smaller deficit compared with forecasts in May's budget. 
""I anticipate that based on these figures today and other data that has come that we will achieve a better-than-the-budgeted outcome,"" he told reporters.

It also supports the optimistic outlook offered by the Reserve Bank of Australia this week, even though it kept official interest rates unchanged at a record-low 1.5% for a 13th month in a row. 
In a speech Tuesday in Brisbane, RBA Gov. Philip Lowe said he has been encouraged by recent strength in investment and full-time jobs growth, something the RBA has been anticipating for some time. 
The solid second-quarter GDP result was supported by strength in exports and public spending, led by infrastructure construction. 
Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB, said the strength of growth firms up the probability that the next move in Australian interest rates will be higher. 
""This fits with the RBA's upbeat view on the economic outlook, is consistent with the next move in rates being up rather than down, and raises the risk that the RBA may hike sooner than we currently expect in 2019,"" Mr. Oster added. 
Iron-ore prices, still an important factor in economic growth, have been higher than expected over recent months, fanning confidence and generating added income for resource companies. 
Higher consumer spending helped growth in the quarter, but lingering pessimism among consumers continues to cloud an otherwise sunny outlook for the economy. Record household debt combined with slow wages growth are keeping Australians' cash in their wallets. 
Households savings continued to fall in the quarter, reaching a new low since the global financial crisis in 2008, while income indicators remained flat across the board. 
A further complication is coming from the Australian dollar, which has risen to its highest level in over two years in recent months. That could weigh on exports, economic growth and inflation. 
The headwinds confronting the Australian economy are significant enough to keep interest rates low for some time.

Bernie&#160;Sanders&#160;promised on Thursday to work with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election, but did not formally pull out of the race for the White House. 
Continue Reading Below 
Sanders&#160;did not endorse Clinton during an online speech to his supporters, but made it clear he was shifting his focus to building a grassroots movement to fight for his liberal policy agenda and transform the Democratic Party. 
""The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly, and I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time,"" the U.S. senator from Vermont said. 
""I also look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to transform the Democratic Party so that it becomes a party of working people and young people, and not just wealthy campaign contributors,"" he said in a speech broadcast from his hometown of Burlington, Vermont. 
Sanders, who has resisted pressure from Democrats to exit the White House race and back Clinton since she clinched the party nomination last week, said he would keep fighting for his goals of reducing income inequality, removing big money from politics and reining in Wall Street. 
""Defeating Donald Trump cannot be our only goal. We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become,"" he said. ""And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1,900 delegates.""

Sanders&#160;has kept his campaign alive as leverage to force concessions from Clinton on his policy goals during deliberations on the party's issues platform, and on the reforms he seeks in the Democratic Party's nominating process. 
But he has laid off some staff, stopped campaigning and dropped plans to court unbound delegates in an unspoken acknowledgment the former secretary of state will be the nominee. 
Sanders, who met with Clinton on Tuesday night after the nominating process ended, said he would continue his discussions with her campaign to make certain ""the Democratic Party passes the most progressive platform in its history, and that Democrats actually fight for that agenda."" 
""Our vision for the future of this country is not some kind of fringe idea. It is not a radical idea. It is mainstream. It is what millions of Americans believe in and want to see happen,""&#160;Sanderssaid.

160735	458667	TRUE	right	http://thepoliticalinsider.com/federal-workers/	publisher	http://thepoliticalinsider.com/	2014-05-27	Quiz: What Percentage of Federal Workers Don?t Trust the Government?	"
 
Federal News Radio surveyed over 1,900 federal employees, members of the private sector, and retirees to gauge the level of trust between Feds and their agencies on various issues. And their findings were that most federal employees don?t trust the Federal Government. 
 
The survey of nearly 2,000 workers&#160;revealed&#160;that 70% rate their trust in the government at or below 5 on a 10-point scale, with 10 being ?complete trust? and 1 being ?don?t trust at all.? 
 
Less than 3% rate the government at a 9 or 10, and more than 90% said the government&#160;needs to rebuild trust with its employees. 
 
The responses were varied, but the primary reasons for lack of trust included retaliation against whistle blowers, intimidation from management, pay freezes, buyouts, lack of support from management, and political games. 
 
What?s unimaginable is that these are federal workers and they are helping to pull the levers of government. &#160;If people don?t trust their co-workers, how can the citizens trust anything that is being accomplished in Washington and beyond?

Mr. Ryan, in a speech to manufacturers in Washington, isn't expected to delve into the details that divide Republicans or the negotiations between the Trump administration and members of Congress. 
Continue Reading Below 
""We need to get this done in 2017,"" he will say, according to excerpts distributed by his office. ""Transformational tax reform can be done, and we are moving forward."" 
Mr. Ryan's speech to the National Association of Manufacturers, sandwiched between cable news appearances, is meant to build momentum and public support for the party's aims. Republicans face significant obstacles, but many see a tax overhaul as a political necessity that would deliver on one of their core campaign promises. For now, taxes are secondary to health care and other policy issues. But the GOP is planning a busy fall. 
Tax policy would gain momentum if Republicans can pass a health law that repeals parts of former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act and cuts hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes that wouldn't have to be addressed as part of a tax plan. Failure on health care would create complications for a tax bill, but it might also create a new sense of urgency. 
Among the current challenges facing Republicans: 
-- The biggest is internal opposition -- particularly in the Senate -- to Mr. Ryan's plan to add a border adjustment to the corporate tax, which would tax imports and exempt exports. Mr. Ryan has acknowledged the concerns, but he is also forging ahead in the absence of an alternative.

The border adjustment, Mr. Ryan argues, wouldn't just provide an estimated $1 trillion over a decade to pay for lower tax rates. By basing taxes on sales instead of profits, it would also act as a backstop to prevent companies from shifting profits abroad in a system where the U.S. stops taxing companies' foreign income. 
""We are actually unique in the world in the way we discourage capital from coming back to America and how we incentivize offshoring jobs,"" Mr. Ryan will say Tuesday. ""We must think differently, so that once again we make things here and export them around the world."" 
-- Republicans also have to decide whether they want a tax cut or a revamp of the system that would leave federal tax collections roughly unchanged. Conservatives and some parts of the Trump administration favor a tax cut. Mr. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) have said they favor a so-called revenue-neutral approach -- meaning that total taxes wouldn't change much while rates get lowered and some breaks vanish -- after counting revenue generated by the tax plan's economic effects. 
-- Intra-Republican disputes threaten the GOP effort with every trade-off. Just this week, seven House Republicans from New York and New Jersey signed a letter asking the administration -- and by extension, the speaker -- to reconsider a plan to repeal the deduction for state and local taxes. 
-- To even get to tax policy, Republicans will have to pass a budget that allows them to use reconciliation, the procedural tool that enables a simple majority vote in the Senate. That will require bridging gaps between Republicans who emphasize spending cuts and those who want to spend more on the military. 
-- Then there is a pile of narrower issues that will crop up as Republican members find their home-state and home-district industries objecting to pieces of the tax bill. 
The result may not be the tax plan Mr. Ryan first laid out a year ago or a copy of the temporary tax cuts that President George W. Bush pushed through in 2001 and 2003. But Republicans say they are determined to do something ahead of next year's primaries and midterm elections.

Dear Tax Talk,I am a U.S. citizen married to an Italian woman. We purchased our home for 350,000 euro here in Rome and have lived in it for six years. We may move back to the U.S. If we sell this property for 600,000 euros, we will have a capital gain of 250,000 euros. Will we be exempt from paying the taxes? Can we file our taxes jointly even though my wife is Italian with a green card? What is the bottom line? Does it depend also on state laws as well? Are there any other surprises to look out for? Thanks.-Duane

Dear Duane,When they sell their main home, unmarried taxpayers can exclude up to $250,000 in gain; married taxpayers, $500,000. U.S. citizens pay tax on their worldwide income and capital gains. The capital gains exclusion applies to a home located in the states or abroad. Your simple question has many issues such as marital status, residency and computing gain.As a green card holder, your wife is considered a U.S. taxpayer and would be required to file a U.S. tax return. Since you're married, you would most likely file a joint tax return with her and qualify for the higher exclusion. You would qualify for the higher exclusion if you both have lived in the house for more than two years and either one of you or both have owned the home for two years prior to its sale. 
Your wife's green card status may be adversely affected by claiming residency (i.e., her main home) in a foreign country. You should consult with an immigration attorney on this issue. From a tax standpoint, the higher exclusion is a benefit. 
You need to figure your U.S. dollar cost in the home at the time you purchased it, at the time you made any improvements and at the time you sell it using the prevailing exchange rate. For example, six years ago one euro was worth about $1.20, so the home's cost was $420,000. Today the euro is about $1.30, so if the home is sold for 600,000 euros, the U.S. equivalent is $780,000. The capital gain therefore would be $360,000 -- well below the married couple exclusion. Although part of the gain relates to the strengthening of the euro, the whole gain is considered as part of the sale of the home and thus eligible for exclusion. 
Since you are not a resident in the U.S., you should not have a state income tax issue.

Cocoa for July lost 0.9% to $1,824 a ton on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange. The cocoa market is entering the smaller mid-crop season in West Africa, the world's largest growing region, and favorable growing conditions are preventing any bullish moves in cocoa from taking off. About 15-20% of the full year's cocoa harvest comes from the mid-crop. 
Continue Reading Below 
Supply of cocoa is expected to outstrip demand this year. The International Cocoa Organization estimated that production of cocoa will surpass demand in the 2016/2017 season that began in October by 264,000 tons, helped along by record production in Ivory Coast, the largest grower of cocoa in the world. The West African nation is set to produce 1.9 million tons, a 20% increase over last year. 
With demand up 2.9% and production up 15% globally, the organization (which represents cocoa producing and consuming countries) said the world is expected to have its first significant surplus in six years. 
""The only thing that could make cocoa rally is some kind of weather. We need weather to get the market going,"" said Nicholas Gentile, managing partner at NickJen Capital Management. Mr. Gentile said he expects cocoa to trade in a sideways range of about $300 unless some major weather event threatens cocoa production. A second significant year of surplus, he said, could see the market trading down to $1,500 a ton. 
WeatherBell Analytics in New York said steadier rainfall has resumed in West Africa and that above normal showers are expected in Ivory Coast and Ghana over the next 10 days. 
In other markets, raw sugar for July lost 0.3% to 16.09 cents a pound, arabica coffee futures were up 0.8% at $1.3445 a pound, frozen concentrated orange juice for July was up 0.4% at $1.5895 a pound and July cotton rose 0.2% to 79.08 cents a pound.

Kicking off tech earnings season, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) revealed fourth-quarter results on Wednesday that narrowly topped estimates, but also issued a cautious outlook for the first quarter of 2013. 
Continue Reading Below 
After initially coming under pressure, shares of the global commerce platform and payments company ticked slightly higher in extended trading. 
EBay said it earned $927 million, or 70 cents a share, last quarter, compared with $1.23 billion, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had been calling for EPS of 69 cents. 
Net revenue rose 18% to $3.99 billion, narrowly topping the Street?s view of $3.98 billion. 
?We had a great finish to an excellent year, with fourth quarter results exceeding our expectations,"" CEO John Donahoe said in a statement. ""EBay Marketplaces in particular had a terrific fourth quarter, with growth in the U.S. accelerating three points, outpacing ecommerce."" 
EBay?s fourth-quarter results were boosted by a 16% jump in eBay marketplaces net revenue to $2.05 billion. Gross merchandise volume, excluding vehicles, gained 16% to $19.11 billion. 
Payments net revenue soared 24% to $1.54 billion last quarter, highlighted by a 24% leap in total payment volume to $41.47 billion. 
The company also continues to build out its mobile offerings, doubling its annual mobile volume to $13 billion. EBay said PayPal handled nearly $14 billion in mobile payment volume in 2012, tripling the volume from 2011. 
However, eBay?s outlook may give some shareholders pause. The company projected first-quarter non-GAAP EPS of 60 cents to 62 cents, compared with consensus calls from analysts for 63 cents. Revenue is seen ranging between $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion, which would trail the Street?s view of $3.80 billion. 
Management also forecasted 2013 non-GAAP EPS of $2.70 to $2.75 on revenue of $16 billion to $16.5 billion. By comparison, Wall Street had been anticipating full-year EPS of $2.74 on revenue of $16.3 billion. 
EBay said it expects both its mobile and PayPal mobile to services to exceed $20 billion in volume in 2013. 
PayPal ended the fourth quarter with about 123 million registered accounts, adding almost two million accounts a month in the quarter. 
San Jose-based eBay gained 0.43% to $53.13 in after-hours trading Wednesday evening, putting the stock on track to extend its 73% surge over the past 12 months.

Both companies have seen their revenue decline due to tepid demand for optical component products in China, but the hope of a design win at Apple for 3D sensing chips has given investors in both optimism, though that is now leaning in Lumentum's favor. 
At Finisar, execution issues Opens a New Window. have reportedly delayed any new-iPhone-related gains. 
Continue Reading Below 
Therefore, investors have preferred Lumentum since it has promised a major spike in 3D sensing revenue given its $200 million order pipeline, mainly from a single customer. But is this reason good enough to bet on Lumentum instead of Finisar? Let's take a look. 
Lumentum has built a sizable revenue pipeline from 3D sensing products and reported just over $1 billion in total revenue in the recently concluded fiscal year. And most of the gains from the 3D sensing opportunity are yet to be realized, as the company generated just $5 million in revenue from these chips last quarter. Therefore, sales of 3D sensing chips to Apple could significantly boost Lumentum's top line. 
Furthermore, Lumentum is busy increasing its manufacturing capacity in light of increased demand for 3D sensing chips. Additionally, the chipmaker is trying to improve manufacturing yields. 
Last quarter, Lumentum's revenue fell close to 8% from the prior-year period thanks to a decline in optical component sales. More specifically, the chipmaker lost almost $15 million in revenue from this segment in the fourth quarter, which means that its 3D sensing opportunity could be enough to mitigate any weakness here.

Moreover, the optical component business could stabilize on the back of inventory restocking by Chinese telecom companies, helping Lumentum bring its revenue growth back on track as 3D sensing orders start materializing. 
Finisar had drummed up a lot of hype earlier this year when management dropped hints that it was in the running Opens a New Window. to supply vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) chips to Apple for enabling 3D sensing applications. This wasn't surprising as Apple was supposed to tap multiple suppliers for 3D sensing chips, and Finisar looked like one of the beneficiaries. 
But the company's latest quarterly report revealed that it has run into production issues Opens a New Window. with the 3D sensing chips, so any shipments to Apple would be delayed by a quarter. Optimists might say that Finisar's iPhone-related gains have been delayed by a quarter. But it could lose a share of the pie if other suppliers shore up their production capacity and get bigger contracts from Apple. 
Finisar's guidance doesn't inspire confidence, either, as the rate of decline in its revenue is expected to accelerate in the ongoing quarter. Weakness in optical component demand and uncertainty at Apple seem to have dented management's confidence in the company's ability to deliver top-line growth. 
This makes the stock a hard sell to investors as Lumentum seems to be better-placed to make a comeback given its solid 3D sensing pipeline, which is the crucial difference between the two companies. 
Lumentum clearly looks like the better bet as it has already started benefiting from the iPhone opportunity, which will allow it to cover up for the weak optical component demand. Finisar's prospects, on the other hand, remain clouded with uncertainty. Not surprisingly, Lumentum's earnings-per-share estimates have taken off in recent months, while Finisar's estimates have had a steep drop-off. 
This makes it even easier for investors to make a choice between these two optical component suppliers.

After last quarter's rare dip in distributable cash flow Opens a New Window., Holly Energy Partners (NYSE: HEP) came back strong in the fourth quarter with an impressive earnings report. The addition of new assets was the reason for these impressive results. Let's take a look at Holly Energy Partners' most recent results to see how the company was able to so quickly reverse course after a tough prior quarter.

*in millions, except per-share data. Source: Holly Energy Partners earnings release. 
The big uptick this past quarter came from the addition of new assets including the Woods Cross refinery units that were brought on in the prior quarter. The addition of new assets added $18.3 million in new revenue, which also offset some modest revenue declines at its existing pipeline and storage facilities. Not all of that additional revenue flowed to the bottom line because there were also some increased interest expenses. To fund the acquisition of its newest refining assets, the company took out $400 million in 6% senior notes back in June. These added about $6 million in quarterly interest expenses that were part of the reason we saw lower earnings per share compared to this time last year.

What matters more to Holly Energy Partners investors, though, is the cash flow results, and the company didn't disappoint on that end. Total distributable cash flow increased by 9% compared to this time last year, which gave management enough confidence to raise its distribution by 7.5% compared to the prior quarter. This marked the 49th consecutive quarter with a distribution increase. 
As far as operations, it was a pretty quiet quarter. The acquisition of its new refining assets at parent company HollyFrontier's (NYSE: HFC) Woods Cross refinery were brought online at the beginning of the month and we got to see what a full quarter of those assets will do for the bottom line. Pipeline volumes for refined product and crude oil pipelines was less than several of its clients' contracted minimum volumes, and as a result it received$2.7 million in prior shortfalls billed to shippers. Holly Energy Partners expects these shortfall payments will continue for some time as several shippers are not meeting minimum volume commitments at this time. 
On a little housekeeping note, the company did break out its results into five segments: Refinedproduct pipelines, intermediate pipelines, crude pipelines, terminal, tankage, and lading racks, and refinery processing units. Expect future quarterly results to be broken down based on these lines. 
CEO George Damiris on the company's performance following the acquisition of the Woods Cross refining units: 
Based on the initial results from the Wood Cross refining acquisition, it looks as though it has so far met expectations. Distributable cash flow is up and is helping to offset some weakness in its pipeline segments. This should help to keep the company's quarterly distribution increase streak alive for a few more quarters. Investors in Holly Energy Partners should be encouraged by these results, but should keep an eye out for future growth because the backlog of new projects is looking quite thin.

In my opinion, one of the greatest ways to build wealth is by trading very little and holding onto stocks with durable competitive advantages for decades. But, that isn't to say investors shouldn't have a few stocks in their portfolios with a larger risk and reward. If you're looking for a bold bet in the stock market, these three companies certainly have large potential catalysts, but they're also far from a sure thing. 
After the nuclear power plant disaster in Japan, along with the slowdown in nuclear investment in the U.S. market, a stockpile of uranium has depressed prices, which has sent shares of Cameco Corp (NYSE: CCJ) plunging. In fact, only five of Japan's nuclear reactors have resumed operations, but most of the remaining 20 reactors should restart within the next two years. 
Nuclear reactors. Image source: Getty Images.

Still, with those reactors coming back online and China's nuclear reactor count poised to surge, many expect that surplus of uranium to turn into a deficit by 2021, and for prices to improve starting next year. That would be a boon for Cameco, but the stock is really a bold bet that nuclear energy will boom in China and catch on around the world as the planet needs energy yet must mitigate contributing to global warming. 
At the moment, China has roughly 34 nuclear reactors in operation with another 20 under construction and even more planned to begin construction in the years ahead. In terms of gigawatts electrical (GWe), China's nuclear capacity is set to double by 2020-2021, to 58 GWe, and then nearly triple to 150 GWe by 2030. That's not taking into consideration the new reactors coming from India, South Korea, and Russia, so it's easy to see how demand and prices for uranium could quickly increase by the end of the decade. 
Cameco has positioned itself as an industry leader and ranks among lower-cost producers of uranium thanks to its enviable asset that includes a high-grade McArthur River mine in Saskatchewan. It's a bold bet that as the world continues to deal with increasing carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming, more countries will turn to nuclear energy to produce energy and reduce greenhouse emissions. 
Much of the bold bet on Cameco relies on China's ambitious nuclear plans, as it has already replaced the USA as the world's largest contributor of carbon dioxide emissions, and if those plans falter, uranium prices could remain depressed, and Cameco's stock would feel the pain. 
Ask any analyst within the automotive industry and they'll tell you this might be as good as it gets when it comes to sales of new vehicles in the U.S. market. That's not good news for investors of major automakers that often rely on increasing sales or market share to drive top-line growth. 
Image source: Getty Images. 
However, the automotive industry is likely to be a whole different ballgame in 10 years, and investing inGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) is a bold bet it can evolve to take advantage of new revenue streams to push its top and bottom lines higher. 
""GM is at the forefront of redefining the future of personal mobility,"" said GM President Dan Ammann, in a press release, continuing: 
The Maven brand Ammann mentioned is testing out a number of projects in the U.S. market. So far, its testing has been simple and is serving roughly 5,000 residents between New York and Chicago, with other cities in the early stages. The Maven City car-sharing program comes at a cost of $8 an hour including insurance and fuel; consumers can reserve a vehicle at more than 15 sites throughout Chicago. Or consumers can opt for Chicago Express Drive, which GM launched in March with Lyft. Express Drive enables Lyft drivers in the area to rent a Chevrolet Equinox crossover for $99 per week. 
Investors can thank young tech companies, like Uber, for opening the eyes of the ancient major automakers and showing them that there are plenty of new revenue streams out there ripe for the picking -- GM is one bold bet that Detroit's largest automaker will figure out how to generate revenue in new ways. 
Amazon has made many things clear since bursting onto the retail scene, and one of those things is that if you're not building your online retail presence, you're not doing it right. Few, if any, clothing retailers realize this better than department store operator Macy's (NYSE: M). It made that clear in its recent ""Macy's, Inc. Outlines Moves to Drive Profitable Growth and Enhance Shareholder Value"" presentation, which lifted the stock 17% as it simultaneously announced quarterly results that showed a drop in both earnings and revenues.

One takeaway from that presentation was that the upcoming move to shutter the doors on 100 Macy's locations, despite it being a tough decision to make, was the best move for the struggling retailer. More specifically, starting next year, 100 full-line Macy's stores (out of a total of 675) will close in an attempt to focus invested capital and managerial talent on better-performing locations in prime markets. 
Macy's is essentially a bold bet on many things that all fall under the umbrella of management's execution. Shuttering 100 stores that are still cash-flow positive emphasizes that the company is forward-looking, but this is a bet that management will continue to drive smart decisions going forward. Those decisions include shifting store exposure to less commoditized segments -- think jewelry and beauty products -- as well as increasing the presence of its private-label clothing to try to differentiate itself and generate pricing power. 
Buying into Macy's is a bold bet that in a world where Amazon is taking it to brick-and-mortar retailers, Macy's can combine its most profitable stores with its growing online presence and create the best of both worlds. Macy's has the tools to get it done, but it will take phenomenal execution.

"b'<article id=""0412726"" published-at=""2016-08-28"" title=""3 Bold Bets in the Stock Market for Brave and Risk-Tolerant Investors""><p /> \n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n<p>In my opinion, one of the greatest ways to build wealth is by trading very little and holding onto stocks with durable competitive advantages for decades. But, that isn\'t to say investors shouldn\'t have a few stocks in their portfolios with a larger risk and reward. If you\'re looking for a bold bet in the stock market, these three companies certainly have large potential catalysts, but they\'re also far from a sure thing.</p> \n<p>After the nuclear power plant disaster in Japan, along with the slowdown in nuclear investment in the U.S. market, a stockpile of uranium has depressed prices, which has sent shares of Cameco Corp (NYSE: CCJ) plunging. In fact, only five of Japan\'s nuclear reactors have resumed operations, but most of the remaining 20 reactors should restart within the next two years.</p> \n<p>Nuclear reactors. Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n<p>Advertisement</p> \n<p>Still, with those reactors coming back online and China\'s nuclear reactor count poised to surge, many expect that surplus of uranium to turn into a deficit by 2021, and for prices to improve starting next year. That would be a boon for Cameco, but the stock is really a bold bet that nuclear energy will boom in China and catch on around the world as the planet needs energy yet must mitigate contributing to global warming.</p> \n<p>At the moment, China has roughly 34 nuclear reactors in operation with another 20 under construction and even more planned to begin construction in the years ahead. In terms of gigawatts electrical (GWe), China\'s nuclear capacity is set to double by 2020-2021, to 58 GWe, and then nearly triple to 150 GWe by 2030. That\'s not taking into consideration the new reactors coming from India, South Korea, and Russia, so it\'s easy to see how demand and prices for uranium could quickly increase by the end of the decade.</p> \n<p>Cameco has positioned itself as an industry leader and ranks among lower-cost producers of uranium thanks to its enviable asset that includes a high-grade McArthur River mine in Saskatchewan. It\'s a bold bet that as the world continues to deal with increasing carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming, more countries will turn to nuclear energy to produce energy and reduce greenhouse emissions.</p> \n<p>Much of the bold bet on Cameco relies on China\'s ambitious nuclear plans, as it has already replaced the USA as the world\'s largest contributor of carbon dioxide emissions, and if those plans falter, uranium prices could remain depressed, and Cameco\'s stock would feel the pain.</p> \n<p>Ask any analyst within the automotive industry and they\'ll tell you this might be as good as it gets when it comes to sales of new vehicles in the U.S. market. That\'s not good news for investors of major automakers that often rely on increasing sales or market share to drive top-line growth.</p> \n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n<p>However, the automotive industry is likely to be a whole different ballgame in 10 years, and investing inGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) is a bold bet it can evolve to take advantage of new revenue streams to push its top and bottom lines higher.</p> \n<p>""GM is at the forefront of redefining the future of personal mobility,"" said GM President Dan Ammann, in a press release, continuing:</p> \n<p>The Maven brand Ammann mentioned is testing out a number of projects in the U.S. market. So far, its testing has been simple and is serving roughly 5,000 residents between New York and Chicago, with other cities in the early stages. The Maven City car-sharing program comes at a cost of $8 an hour including insurance and fuel; consumers can reserve a vehicle at more than 15 sites throughout Chicago. Or consumers can opt for Chicago Express Drive, which GM launched in March with Lyft. Express Drive enables Lyft drivers in the area to rent a Chevrolet Equinox crossover for $99 per week.</p> \n<p>Investors can thank young tech companies, like Uber, for opening the eyes of the ancient major automakers and showing them that there are plenty of new revenue streams out there ripe for the picking -- GM is one bold bet that Detroit\'s largest automaker will figure out how to generate revenue in new ways.</p> \n<p>Amazon has made many things clear since bursting onto the retail scene, and one of those things is that if you\'re not building your online retail presence, you\'re not doing it right.

As many retailers wrestle to stay afloat, high-end department giant Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) has announced plans to open a new store concept next month that doesn?t include any merchandise. 
Continue Reading Below 
The store, called Nordstrom Local, will be a fraction of the size of its typical locations (around 3,000 square feet instead of the standard 140,000 square feet) and won?t carry any clothes. Instead, the retailer will offer services such as manicures, on-site tailoring and alcohol to its consumers. 
The new location is scheduled to open early October in West Hollywood, California. It will contain several dressing rooms, where shoppers can try on clothes and accessories with the assistance of a Nordstrom personal stylist ? even though the store won?t stock the merchandise for consumers to buy. Instead, they plan to direct them to purchase the gear online or at one of its other store locations. 
Traditional retailers continue to struggle to compete with ecommerce, with many having to close stores of late. Last week, Gap (NYSE:GPS) announced that it plans to close 200 Gap and Banana Republic locations over the next three years due to ?underperformance.? At the same time, the company announced plans to open 270 locations for its growing brands like Old Navy and Athleta. 
Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) also announced last month that it will be closing an additional 28 Kmart and Sears on top of the 180 locations it already closed in fiscal year 2017 so far. The company previously announced plans to close 150 locations by the end of the third quarter. Department store chains like Macy?s (NYSE:M) and JCPenney (NYSE:JCP) have also announced multiple store closings this year.

Greece has been excluded from the program, which has helped keep a lid on the borrowing rates of the other 18 countries that use the euro currency, partly because the ECB wants more information about potential debt relief measures for the country. 
Continue Reading Below 
While qualifying for the bond-buying program would be ""very useful"" for Greece, the effect would be largely ""symbolic,"" Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said. 
""It is important, but mostly in symbolic terms,"" Tsakalotos said at a financial conference near Athens. ""What we need to do is ensure that the investment community knows there will be a program of access to the markets."" 
Tsakalotos said the government is mindful of not tapping bond markets for financing ""too early"" and that investors know it's not going to be a one-off. 
""But when we do go, we want to ensure that the markets know that it's part of a strategy of going two, three, four times so they understand not the details but the process,"" he said. 
Greece has been eyeing a return to international bond markets for the second time since the country lost access in 2010 and had to seek successive bailouts from other eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund.

Speaking at the conference later Thursday, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras voiced optimism that Greece would be able to tap bond markets ""long before"" the bailout ends in August 2018. 
Tsipras also ruled out recourse to new rescue loans after that, which the country would be forced to do if it fails to attract private sector creditors. 
Interest rates on Greek bonds have fallen sharply since rescue lenders promised this month to restart paying loan installments, following a major new round of reforms and austerity measures in the recession-weary country. 
Klaus Regling, head of the eurozone financial rescue fund, also said Greece was poised to return to the bond market, but blamed delays on an ""unfortunate reversal of the reform process"" in the early stages of the left-wing government. 
""The Greek people ... have suffered many years of salary and pension cuts. This was a painful experience and initially negative for growth. But the adaptation was unavoidable, and a consequence of past policy mistakes,"" Regling said. 
Tsipras insisted that his government was determined to speedily push through its remaining bailout commitments ""without delays or pointless tergiversation."" 
Meanwhile, Greek municipal garbage collectors decided Thursday to return to work after nearly two weeks of protests that left mounds of uncollected refuse in the streets amid a heatwave. 
The workers' union, which wants employees on fixed-time contracts to be granted full-time jobs, said trash collection trucks would hit the streets after midnight. 
Greek authorities had warned that the strike was endangering public health and causing problems during the country's main tourist season. 
Earlier Thursday, about 1,000 garbage collectors marched peacefully through central Athens.

The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, still raging after 12 years of bitter arguments. 
Continue Reading Below 
The WTO said the EU had failed to comply with earlier rulings by the global trade body against all but two of 36 contested measures, including billions of dollars of European government loans to Airbus stretching back decades. 
The loans were a ""genuine and substantial"" cause of significant lost sales for its U.S. competitor Boeing, it said. 
In a blow to Europe's long-held argument that the most recent Airbus plane, the A350, fell outside the case, the WTO said funding for the jet had been subsidized but rejected U.S. claims it fell into the most toxic category of ""prohibited"" aid. 
The United States said Airbus had failed to undo subsidies worth $22 billion, including $4 billion for the A350. 
European industry officials dispute those numbers, saying they overstate the amount of support at stake within the loans.

U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said the subsidies had cost U.S. workers exports worth tens of billions of dollars. 
""We expect the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain ??? some of our closest trading partners ??? to respect WTO rules. We call on them to end subsidized financing of Airbus immediately,"" he said in a statement. 
The EU, however, suggested it would appeal the latest findings, saying it found some of the report ""unsatisfactory"".
